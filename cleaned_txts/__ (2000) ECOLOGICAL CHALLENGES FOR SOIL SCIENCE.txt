                                            ECOLOGICAL CHALLENGES FOR SOIL SCIENCE
                                                                                                            I                                           Soil Science integrates specific contributions f r o m physics, chemistry,                                      biology, and the h u m a n sciences. During the last 2 decades, these approaches, which had primarily developed separately and at different                                      speeds, have been progressively integrated. Ecology has contributed a                                      significant number of integrative concepts and questions, some, such as                                      nutrient cycling and energy budgets, that are rather old, and others, such                                      as soil engineering by macroinvertebrates, the relationship between biodiversity and soil function, and the impact of landscape fractionation,                                      that are more recent.                                         An important issue c o m m o n to all disciplines in Soil Science is that                                      of scales. Ecological studies have shown that similar activities, e.g., the                                      building of solid structures by invertebrates for their sheltering or gut                                      transit of soil for digestion, may affect soil function at different scales,                                      affecting the rates of processes in sometimes opposite directions. The                                      concept of functional domains in soil, derived f r o m soil ecological research, defines a scale a t which physical, chemical, and biological                                      processes can be studied efficiently in a true multidisciplinary approach.                                      Functional domains are specific sites i n soils defined by a main organic                                      resource (leaflitter or soil organic matter), a major regulator, biotic (i.e.,                                      an invertebrate 'engineer' o r roots) or abiotic (like freezing/ thawing or                                      drying/rewetting alternates), a set of structures created by the regulator                                      (for example, fecal pellets, galleries, o r cracks), and a community of dependent invertebrates of smaller size and microorganisms that live in                                      these structures. Functional domains m a y be physically identified in soils                                      and specifically studied using the different disciplinary approaches. Specific micromorphologic, isotopic, and other techniques allow us to address issues at this scale adequately. Ecological research also provides a                                      theoretical background for management of soils at the larger integrative                                      scales of landscape and regions.                                         Essential issues for the near future should use this interdisciplinary approach. Sustainability of cropping systems and maintenance of soil                                      ecosystem services depend more o n an integrated approach than do the                                      extreme developments in single disciplines in isolation that originated                                      the series of problems w e now face: large scale soil erosion, nutrient                                      transfers to neighboring ecosystems, threats of genetically modified organisms, or biodiversity accidents.
