Keywords:                                                While agency has received considerable attention in recent sustainability transitions studies, as well as in the Post-human sociology                                     literature on socio-ecological systems and sustainability transformations, the focus has been on the agency of Change agents                                            humans. Given the emphasis on infrastructures and material culture in sustainability transitions studies, it is Multi-level perspective                                                          surprising that non-human agency has not received more attention. This paper aims to add to the body of work Actor-network theory Food systems transformation                                                          on agency and actor-oriented approaches in sustainability transitions, and addresses this gap by investigating the                                                          role of non-human agency in shaping sustainability transitions. Through an application of Actor-Network Theory,                                                          we followed the Bagrada hilaris pest, and analyzed the roles performed by the Bagrada as a so-called actant                                                          within a network of humans, as part of a transition-in-the-making towards more sustainable food systems. The                                                          Bagrada has been a key actant in provoking changes towards sustainable pest management in Chile, destabilizing                                                          regime practices associated with pesticides, and creating and mediating relationships between different human                                                          actors. In terms of transition theories, particularly the multi-level perspective, this case illustrates the relational                                                          nature of agency. The main theoretical implications are that: a) actants from all levels (niche, regime, landscape)                                                          are linked in networks of relations that make change happen; b) the landscape level is not void of agency; c)                                                          boundaries between levels are fluid. We conclude that relating to non-human actants and understanding how to                                                          mobilize them for normative goals can help catalyze sustainability transitions.
Introduction                                                                            incumbents (Späth et al., 2016; Musiolik et al., 2012; Turnheim and                                                                                            Geels, 2013), technology manufacturers (Budde et al., 2012; Musiolik     The issue of agency has been gaining prominence in sustainability                      and Markard, 2011); policy makers (Quitzau et al., 2012), and inter­ transitions studies (de Haan and Rotmans, 2018; Wittmayer et al.,                          mediary actors (Hargreaves et al., 2013; Kivimaa, 2014). 2017), as well as in the neighbouring field of sustainability trans­                           Understandings of agency in sustainability transitions have been formations (Westley et al., 2011, 2013). Sustainability transitions                        based on concepts such as (collective) institutional entrepreneurship studies were initially criticized for an over-functionalistic approach and                 (Duygan et al., 2019; Hassink et al., 2018; Heiskanen et al., 2019; for neglecting issues of agency and power struggles (Duygan et al., 2019;                  Hermans et al., 2013; Jolly et al., 2016), and institutional work Fischer and Newig, 2016; Grin et al., 2011; Shove and Walker, 2010;                        (Fuenfschilling and Truffer, 2016; Rogers et al., 2015).

Empirical studies have shown how                         (Musiolik et al., 2012; Kivimaa et al., 2019a; Westley et al., 2013); the diverse actor groups can contribute to transitions; including: social                      creation of legitimacy and institutional support (Kivimaa et al., 2019a). movements (Ornetzeder and Rohracher, 2013; Seyfang et al., 2014);                          Other studies have indicated the role of intermediary actors as relevant

In this article we elucidate the agency role of a                    meaningful insofar as it is materially grounded in a network (the landscape-level actor, the Bagrada pest, in provoking sustainability                meaning of pest management is dependent on the material presence of transition in the Chilean agricultural sector.

Connecting the MLP and ANT to unravel non-human agency ence and technology study scholars Michel Callon and Bruno Latour                      Some scholars have pointed-out that it is unclear how relational (1981).

Instead, Latour presents ANT as a it refers to human actants. Following the logic of ANT, any action is the           method of how to examine and describe relations and actions.

As such, a change agent            but on how the network forms; thus, on the work that actants do to (or mediator in ANT terms) is any ‘entity’ – whether this is ‘social’,              create and sustain those networks and relationships (Müller and Schurr, ‘natural’ or ‘technical’ – that problematizes or destabilizes a network, or         2016).

For instance, problematization relates to actions              for instance, radical changes in farmers’ practices (e.g. eliminate such as vision making, or the framing of problems and solutions (Bakker           chemical use), or other political and institutional dimensions.

Furthermore, in line     We see the Bagrada as a transformer in that it has transformed other            with previous authors, we do not attribute to the Bagrada, and other actants roles and practices and, in doing so, it has also changed the re­           non-humans as well, material determinism (Latour, 2005; Legun and lations between actants, both human and non-human.

With regards to pesticides, at the beginning these were the most efficient technology to tackle the Bagrada –for both                      Previous transition studies on strategic agency to support regime farmers and public agencies–, to later on being conceived by public                 change have shown and emphasize how agency is relational and agencies as dangerous artefacts which’s application must be reduced,                constituted by the interactions and dependences among different actors while inefficient and uneconomic technologies to combat the Bagrada                 (Werbeloff et al., 2016).

In our case we can see that a disregarded by farmers, to being an auspicious solution to control the              transition to less and responsible pesticide use and more Bagrada for them and public agencies. These examples illustrate how                 biologically-based pest-management strategies had been attempted fundamental changes in actants roles and in their relations are for                 previously by regime-based actors as the INIA, and efforts were under­ advancing a transition process.                                                     way to convince farmers to switch onto these alternative practices.     These findings have several theoretical implications for under­                 Alone, these discussions were unlikely to lead to significant practical standing (non-human) agency in sustainability transitions. First, as                change in the short-term. Moreover, despite these regime-based in­ indicated above, the Bagrada’s capacity of changing actants roles and               termediaries intentions and normative ideals for IPM, what finally their relations, constitutes a significant role in advancing this transition-       triggered this particular transition-in-the-making were the conflicts that in-the-making. This is in line with Wittmayer et al.

These findings illustrate that essement emphasize the importance of actions that attempt to                        we should not limit our understanding of agency in transitions to human constantly (re)work on other actants’ roles and relations in order to               agency through intentional, rational and strategic actions, as has so far create, maintain and expand the network. Therefore, reinforcing Witt­               been the focus of most transition and transformation studies about mayer et al., 2017, we consider that the capacity of changing actants               agency (Brown et al., 2013; Farla et al., 2012; Geels, 2020; Werbeloff roles –by creating new roles, breaking down or altering existing ones               et al., 2016; Westley et al., 2013). While intentional human action is a (Wittmayer et al., 2017)–, should be consider as a relevant agentic role            type of action, it is not the only type of action nor is incompatible with within studies and frameworks about agency in transition, and also                  other forms of agency (Sayes, 2014). In line with previous studies addressed as part of the set of actions of ‘institutional work’.

Our findings also concede with previous studies management, as the tools and discourses of IPM and biological con­                 indicating that distinctive boundaries between niche and regime trols were readily available and pushed by the INIA, mainly.

We can also see how their actions for           that hold the network together (Jørgensen, 2012; Diaz et al., 2013). In creating farmers’ awareness about an informed and responsible pesti­               the case of the Bagrada we see this in the difficulty associated with cides use, and encouraging them to adopt IPM and biological control                categorizing biological pest agents as niche or landscape actants, as well methods, are supported and dependent on non-human actants; including               as in the important role for advancing the IPM niche played by the INIA the Bagrada, entomo-pathogenic fungus, plant-based corridors. Further,             and SAG regime-based intermediaries, and the fact that the network of the pathogenic nature of the relationship between the Bagrada and an               actants supporting the IPM niche belong to the landscape, regime, and entomo-pathogenic fungus has led to an expansion of research and a                 regime-niche intermediate levels, rather than to the niche level. This promising pathway forward for biological controls. While we focus on               reinforces previous studies that, through a crossing-over between MLP the Bagrada as a non-human actant, it is not a bounded, solitary actant,           and ANT, have unraveled the fluidity of niches (Diaz et al., 2013). but the agency it has is very much defined by its network relations.                   Second, supporting previous studies (Antadze and McGowan, 2017;     This serves to emphasize the ways that an actant is, in part, defined          Avelino et al., 2017; Svensson and Nikoleris, 2018; Weng et al., 2020), by other humans and non-humans’ capacity and likely to be changed by               the landscape no longer appears as a level without agency, void of actors them. As such, our findings underpin previous transition studies                   (or actants) performing functions that help to advance transitions emphasizing agency as relational and constituted by the interactions and           (Fischer and Newig, 2016), nor as a level in which its material aspects dependences among different actors (Werbeloff et al., 2016; Rossi et al.,          lack autonomous causal efficacy (Svensson and Nikoleris, 2018).

The usefulness of of particular strategies played by transformative actors (Westley et al.,          distinct levels for the understanding and categorization of change 2011), or, as the consequence of the intentional actions of different              agents, and actors in general, has already been questioned by previous typological actor roles, that is, ideal types of transformative change             studies (El Bilali, 2019; Elzen et al., 2012; Jørgensen, 2012; Shove and agents with different strategies and abilities (de Haan and Rotmans,               Walker, 2010; Smith et al., 2010).

(2019b) who use an ‘ecology of intermediaries’ perspective (or, as in our case, an ‘ecology of        6. Conclusion: theoretical and practical recommendations for actants’). Such a perspective emphasizes that, while some type of in­              transition studies termediaries (e.g. niche, systemic) are the most important for transi­ tions, these need be complemented by a full ecology of intermediaries;                 While agency in transitions has received considerable attention including regime based intermediaries (Kivimaa et al., 2019b). Or, in              lately in transition studies, this is focused on agency of humans. Nonline with the authors of previous transition studies, through the appli­           humans within transition studies –such as infrastructures or the natu­ cation of relational approaches such as ANT (Geels, 2010; Genus and                ral environment–have been recognized as relevant factors influencing Coles, 2008; Garud and Gehman, 2012; Diaz et al., 2013) or assemblages             sustainability transitions.
