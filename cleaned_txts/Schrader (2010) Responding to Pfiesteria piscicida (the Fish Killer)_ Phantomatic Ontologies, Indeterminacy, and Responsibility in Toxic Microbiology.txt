Research into the insidious effects of the dinoflagellates Pfiesteria piscicida  (the fish killer) that thrive in waters over-enriched with nutrients, has received considerable attention by both the media and government agencies concerned with public and environmental health. After nearly two decades of research, the question of whether Pfiesteria can be regarded the 'causative agent' of massive fish kills in the estuaries of the US mid-Atlantic could not be scientifically settled. In contrast to policymakers, who attribute the absence of a scientific consensus to gaps in scientific knowledge and uncertainties regarding the identity and behavior of the potentially toxic dinoflagellates, I propose that an inseparable entanglement of Pfiesteria's  identities and their toxic activities challenges conventional notions of causality that seek to establish a connection between independent events in linear time. Building on Karen Barad's framework of agential realism, I argue for a move from epistemological uncertainties to ontological indeterminacies that follow from Pfiesteria's contributions to agency, as the condition for responsible and objective science. In tracking discrepant experimental enactments of Pfiesteria that have been mobilized as evidence for and against their toxicity, I investigate how criteria for what counts as evidence get built into the experimental apparatuses and suggest that the joint possibilities of causality and responsibility vary with the temporalities of the objects enacted. This discussion seeks to highlight a thorough entanglement of epistemic/ontological concerns with the ecological/political relevance of particular experiments. Finally, I introduce a new kind of scientific object that - borrowing from Derrida - I call phantomatic. Phantoms don't emerge as such, but appear as traces and are associated with specific matters of concern.

     and back again. Called Pfiesteria piscicida, this killer dinoflagellate cap      tured the attention of scientists worldwide when it emerged 6 years ago      (1991) from the murk of North Carolina's coastal estuaries, the phantom      suspect in a string of mass killings that destroyed more than a billion fish.      (Warrick, 1997)
   What might read like a passage from a murder mystery or science fiction novel is the beginning of a report on years of conflict-ridden research into the toxicity of a single-celled microorganism: the dinofla gellate Pfiesteria piscicida. Joby Warrick, staff writer of the Washington Post, was not alone in finding inspiration in sci-fi literature to describe  the scientific findings about this toxic dinoflagellate. While tremendously  important to the health of our oceans, dinoflagellates are perhaps best known as contributors to so-called 'harmful algal blooms' (HABs),  sometimes referred to as 'red tides'. Most of them, however, are not  toxic1 and no other dinos2 have been observed to prey on fish. Media  reports referring to Pfiesteria piscicida as the 'cell from hell', 'killer algae', or 'microscopic monster' proliferated in the late 1990s, when massive fish kills occurred in the estuaries of North Carolina and Maryland (Greer, 1993; Macilwain, 1997).     Until Pfiesteria made their first public appearance, most of the fish kills  that had increasingly plagued the two largest estuaries of the US were ascribed to unknown causes, or alternatively to 'naturally' occurring condi tions of low dissolved oxygen levels (Burkholder, 1998). The term 'phantom dinoflagellate' was introduced into the scientific literature by Jo Ann Burkholder and colleagues from the Center for Applied Aquatic Ecology at North Carolina State University, before the dinos were taxonomically bap  tized Pfiesteria piscicida according to their lethal actions: 'piscicida' literally means 'fish killer'. In 1992, Burkholder and colleagues published a Letter to Nature with the title 'New "phantom" dinoflagellate is the causative agent of major estuarine fish kills'. In this first of a long series of publications Burkholder et al. (1992) not only announced the 'discovery' of a 'new' toxic microorganism, but also suggested a possible 'cause' for the increasing num ber of fish kills in North Carolina's estuaries. Linking Pfiesteria blooms to water pollutants, predominantly from the flushing of untreated hog waste  into North Carolina's estuaries, on one hand, and human health risks3 asso ciated with the toxic outbreaks on the other, Burkholder et al.'s publications  initiated an enduring controversy over the toxicity of Pfiesteria piscicida. Since the main nutrient polluters of North Carolina's estuaries also com prise the state's largest industry, the stakes were high in providing evidence for or against Pfiesteria^ toxicity. While the declining seafood and tourist  industries quickly established Pfiesteria as 'a major ecological problem to the economies of several eastern seaboard states' (Gawley & Baden, 1998), the hog and chicken farming industries that line the shores of North Carolina and Maryland's estuaries faced possible regulations concerning their animal waste treatment. Nearly two decades of research, however, could neither decidedly establish nor successfully refute Pfiesteria as the 'causative agent' of major estuarine fish kills. The fact that the controversy is still going on and

little has been settled either scientifically or politically is crucial for my approach and arguments to follow.     Policymakers and governmental agencies charged with the review of Pfiesteria science attribute the absence of consensus to gaps in scientific knowl  edge and uncertainties regarding the identity and behavior of the potentially  toxic dinoflagellates. How uncertainties in scientific knowledges are produced, manipulated, exploited, or contested in order to influence policy decisions has been widely discussed in Science Studies (Star, 1985; Jasanoff, 1987; Shackley & Wynne, 1996; Wynne, 1996; Lynch, 1998). While indebted to these studies,  this paper takes a different approach. Shifting the focus from uncertainties in human knowledges to the materialities of scientific experimentation, I explore how criteria for what counts as ecologically and/or politically relevant get built  into scientific experiments. My analysis of the controversy focuses on a few  selected experiments that have received considerable media attention as evi dence for and against the assertion of Pfiesteria's toxicity. Building on feminist philosopher Karen Barad's (2007) framework of'agential realism' and Jacques Derrida's spectral logic of time, I offer a reading of these experiments, paying particular attention to how the temporalization of the scientific object enables  and disables responsibility in scientific practices. Taking seriously that science  is a material practice to which not only humans contribute, I propose a notion  of responsibility that is attentive to multiple 'histories' and 'agencies' and underpins objectivity in science rather than interfering with it. Rather than  considering responsibility as an attribute of individual scientists or as a 'social'  responsibility that merely concerns the subsequent uses of scientific results, I develop a notion of responsibility in scientific practices as a consequence of  fundamental indeterminacies in Pfiesteria's beings and doings. Responsibility  in my account entails not a particular response, but an enabling of respon  siveness within experimental relatings. I argue that responsible experimenta  tion with the fish killers hinges on maintaining Pfiesteria's ability to respond to  their experimental probings, that is, their response-ability.     In addition, I suggest that the notion of 'uncertainty' in scientific knowledges is inadequate to describe the scientific-political controversies over identities and actions of Pfiesteria. The very idea of an epistemological uncertainty presupposes an a priori separation of the epistemological ques tion of'how we know' from the ontological status of'what we know', where only the former, that is, our knowledge is allowed to vary.4 As Bruno Latour  (2002: 253) puts it most succinctly, 'the epistemological question limits historicity to humans and artifacts and bans it for nonhumans'. I argue for a move from epistemological uncertainties to ontological indeterminacies that follow from Pfiesteria's contributions to material agency as a condition for responsible and objective science.5 Discrepant enactments of Pfiesteria suggest that how we get to know a species experimentally cannot be sepa rated from the ontological question of what/who they are. Since the fish killers only 'are' in relation to fish, the question is ill-posed if it asks 'who toxic Pfiesteria are' before 'what they do' is established.     What Burkholder et al. term 'phantom-like' behavior describes the  spontaneous metamorphoses of a usually benign dinoflagellate into a toxic
                                This content downloaded from               23.165.184.40 on Mon, 13 Oct 2025 08:35:24 UTC                         All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms                                                            278 Social Studies of Science 40/2
 'ambush predator'. Under specific environmental conditions, the dinos  emerge from sediments, collectively attack fish and disappear from the water column as soon as most of their fish prey is dead. Following Burkholder et al.'s experimental descriptions in some detail, I suggest that the term 'phantom' is not just a nickname for the hide-and-seek playing microscopic ambush-predator, but perhaps provides the only way for dinos such as Pfiesteria 'to be' in scientific nature-culture. In other words, the phantomatic character of the toxic dinos is not only a suitable description of Pfiesteria's ephemeral appearances and disappearances, but also most appropriately describes the very nature of their species beings. I hence call  their ontology 'phantomatic'.      A 'phantomatic ontology' is closely allied with Derrida's (1994) notion of hauntology, which describes the paradoxical existence of a specter as neither being nor non-being, neither present nor absent, neither of the  'past' nor of the 'future', but which affirms an indeterminate relationship between being and becoming and between 'past' and 'future'. In holding on  to the notion of ontology, I try to emphasize the necessity of determinations  in scientific experiments. Through a more explicit incorporating of political  and ethical concerns into ontological determinations in experimental practices, the notion of a 'phantomatic ontology' is an attempt to provide with Pfiesteria an alternative to multiple ontologies (Mol, 2002) or uncertain ontologies (Jasanoff, 2005).    With the rise of the study of performances in scientific practices, recently reviewed by Rebecca Herzig (2004), scientific objects have become increasingly lively and active. Nowadays, 'scientific objects have a history' (Daston, 2002: 13). Their 'histories', however, are often tracked as trajectories that presuppose an already established temporal order. Ironically, along with the displacement of human subjects as the only locus of agency and historicity comes an almost exclusionary focus on the pro ductive forces of scientific practices.6 Latour (1999, 2002), for example, grants historicity to microorganisms; their history, however, appears as always already a joint laboratory history of humans and nonhumans.7 What conceptions of temporality and causality are presupposed when the production of scientific objects accounts for effects rather than causes of scientific activities?8 Is there another way to account for the historicity of scientific objects, other than through their coming into being and passing away (Daston, 2002: 13)? In elaborating on the phantomatic character of  the toxic dinos, this paper begins to explore what it could mean for respon sibility in experimentation that microorganisms have 'a history, and not merely a social one', as Judith Butler puts it (1993: 5).     Expanding upon the taxonomy of possible kinds of scientific objects recently provided by John Law and Vicky Singleton (2005), I propose the phantom as a new kind of scientific object. The phantom is importantly dis tinct from all those kinds of objects that suggest a specific topology as either fixed, such as the atemporal Euclidean volume, or variable in time, such as  'fluid objects' that may reshape their configurations in different contexts. Phantoms rather challenge our conception of time as homogenous flow of

self-identical moments, in which a cause by definition precedes its effect. Phantoms are not simply produced, nor are they purely productive, as Law and Singleton's (2005: 347) notion of a 'fire object' - a generator of'links  between presences and absences' - and Hans-Jorg Rheinberger's (1997)   'epistemic things' suggest.9 Phantomatic movements are shaped by dif ferance, where 'the ending -ance remains undecided between the active and the passive', not just moving but also moved, neither passion nor action, but both (Derrida, 1982: 9, emphasis in original). Phantoms do not emerge 'as such'; they appear as traces and are associated with specific matters of con cern. Importantly, a phantom is not an empty signifier, whose meaning is simply deferred until the controversy may become settled. Phantoms are  'agentially real'; they contribute to their own materialization and make demands on us to be accounted for. Responsibility in scientific practices hinges on how their 'agencies' are taken into account.     While what I offer here is a study of 'science-in-the-making' (Latour,  1987) in a very literal sense, I am not claiming to follow scientific practices  in 'real time', as if such a thing would be possible. Indeed, dino science  demonstrates that 'real time' is always already delayed.10 As Rheinberger  puts it, 'a story of what, then, really happened ... presupposes the existence  of an undistorted past "out there" that, from a detached present "in here",  can in principle be grasped by means of an analysis whose means are  supposed not to have been altered by what is going to be synthesized'  (Rheinberger, 1999 [1994]: 417-18). At issue in my dino story is precisely  the question of how the means of science affect that which it studies. My  study is, however, not a 'historical' study from a position of 'reflected  anachronicity' (Rheinberger, 1997: 33), since such an approach 'requires  the existence of a product ... for assessing the condition of its production'  (p. 177). Pfiesteria have not achieved a stable identity; their meaning as a  species and their toxic relationalities to fish are still at stake.     While risky, the advantage of beginning 'in the middle of things' is  that it enables questions not easily accessible from a historical distance or  security of knowledge that would enable the pronouncement of a winner  of the scientific power-knowledge game and the coming-into-being of  an autonomous entity or a product at the end of a research trajectory  (Latour, 1999). The absence of a 'product' describes an indeterminate  situation that requires a response, that is, taking responsibility for specific  relations enacted.
The Stakes of the Controversy While journalists contributed their share to the dramatization of the Pfiesteria issue, often pitching environmental concerns against agricultural interests, the confrontations among scientists have been no less dramatic. Scientists have accused each other of biases, poor experimental practices, inexperi ence, and extrapolations beyond their data. Letters to the editor disputing the narratives of previous publications have been as common in newspapers as in scientific journals (Burkholder & Glasgow, 2002; Litaker et al., 2002b;
                                This content downloaded from               23.165.184.40 on Mon, 13 Oct 2025 08:35:24 UTC                         All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms                                                              280 Social Studies of Science 40/2
Drgon et al., 2005; Gordon et al., 2005). While some scientists have articulated strong opinions regarding the management practice of animal waste treatment (Burkholder, 1998), the controversy can hardly be reduced to competing interests regarding environmental regulations. Scientific publications that affirm (Burkholder et al., 2005; Moeller et al., 2007) and contest (Park et al., 2007) Pfiesteria'% toxicity continue to alternate. What are  the stakes in one of the 'ugliest disputes in environmental science', as one  commentator characterized it (Blankenship, 2002)?    During a 1998 Sea Grant briefing, the Director for Research and Advisory Services at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science states for  example:
     For Pfiesteria-related issues the process of science is in the early stages and,      although much good research has been conducted, there is a high degree      of uncertainty surrounding many issues. Opposing views by scientists are      confusing to the public and to policy-makers, but they are the processes of      science at work. (Burreson, 1998)
For Burreson, the problem seems to be that the slow-moving process of sci ence cannot keep up with the public policy demands for timely decisions. Implicit in this statement is an assumption that further research would reduce uncertainties and scientists would eventually come to a consensus regarding 'who Pfiesteria are', their toxic impact on fish, and associated human health effects.Uncertainties here assume the possibility of certain ties as horizon or telos, and therefore the possibility of their removal. A decade and several million dollars of federal research funding later,11  though, we are still faced with what an editor of Science Magazine has called  'The Pfiesteria Conundrum: More Study, Less Certainty' (Kaiser, 2004).      While the majority of dino scientists and public officials involved have accepted that Pfiesteria play an active role in fish kills and also that their  increased appearances can be correlated to excessive nutrient loadings,12 major disagreements remain about the proper identification of Pfiesteria and the particular pathways of their toxic effects. Since Pfiesteria's toxicity  is highly ephemeral, one of the key 'missing links' appears to be the relation between the 'presence of Pfiesteria' and 'actively toxic Pfiesteria'.       In 2001, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) charged a multidisciplinary panel with the evaluation of the current state of Pfiesteria research. Assuming the possibility of a causal chain from nutrient pollution  to the proliferation of Pfiesteria to fish deaths and human health effects, the panel recognized 'gaps in scientific understanding with attendant uncertain  ties for decision makers' concluding that 'sufficient certainty is needed on each of these points' in order 'to provide a basis for protection of the environ ment and human health' (Samet et al., 2001). The reader of Samet et al.'s  summary report is left with no clear idea of what 'sufficient certainty' in estab  lishing this link could possibly mean. And who will judge?13       Part of what drives the controversy is that various research teams dis agree not about whether Pfiesteria can kill fish, but rather about what experi mental evidence would establish or refute that the species Pfiesteria piscicida

is the 'causative agent' of major estuarine fish kills. At stake for the scientists are simultaneously the meaning of 'causality' and what counts as 'good scientific practice'. Both became closely linked to what counts as evidence needed to advance environmental policies.
Pfiesteria's Entangled Life Histories  'Unlike most species that are considered to be "harmful algae", Pfiesteria is not an alga according to the classical definition (primitive plant-like organ isms)' (Glibert & Burkholder, 2006). Pfiesteria are neither plant nor animal, but can act as both. Pfiesteria prey encompasses almost everything available in the water column, ranging from bacteria to fish tissue. Abrupt changes  in available nutrition can trigger spontaneous transformations, not only of particular life stages, but also in the dinos' entire mode of reproduction.     Pfiesteria spend most of their life as dormant cysts in sediments of the brackish waters of the mid-Atlantic estuaries. Under certain environmental conditions, the dinos, apparently attracted by a large number of fish, emerge from the sediments and metamorphize into free-swimming zoospores.  'The toxic zoospores gather together, alter their random swimming pattern  into directed movement, doubling their swimming speed in the process, and commence predatory behavior upon the targeted fish' (Samet et al., 2001: 641). The fish might first be immobilized with the help of one or more neurotoxins before the zoospores begin to consume their cell content. During the killing period, the dinos rapidly reproduce both sexually and  asexually. Upon fish death Pfiesteria metamorphize into a variety of differ  ent shapes. Toxic zoospores may transform into amoebae and sink to the bottom sediments, where they transform again and hide away as motion  less, dormant and benign cysts.      According to Burkholder & Glasgow (1997), Pfiesteria have an extraor dinarily complex 'life cycle' with at least 24 distinct life stages occurring in  three life forms: flagellated, amoeboid, and encysted (see Fig. 1).      A closer look at the 'life cycle' proposed by Burkholder et al. suggests that it is neither a cycle nor a static web or network, nor anything that could be easily translated into a program - an algorithm that runs in linear time. This compilation of multiple experimental findings depicts a superposition of various, partially overlapping temporal and spatial scales that cannot be easily disentangled. Which of the morphs actually belongs to the fish killer  is part of the ongoing dispute. In addition to a multidimensional environ mental space (different temperature, salinity, organic and inorganic nutri ents), Pfiesteria inhabit multiple temporalities in this picture. Is there any way to tell where Pfiesteria end and their environment begins? Can the  'environmental' conditions, indicated by letters and plus and minus signs, be translated into a well-defined spatially bounded ecological niche?      Toxic morphs are neither a subset nor just a temporal performance of the species Pfiesteria piscicida under fixed environmental conditions. Rather, this 'life-history' simultaneously depicts how one morph responds to various environmental conditions and how changed environmental conditions (for

    Context-dependent development is, according to biologist Scott Gilbert, a widespread and well-established biological phenomenon. The point I am trying to make here, however, exceeds the assertion of 'pheno typic plasticity, the ability of an organism to respond to environmental con ditions by altering its development' (Gilbert, 2002). Pfiesteria's life histories do not describe a definable organism that would pre-exist an environment, await its changes to which it can then respond. Rather, the very distinction between internal or innate characteristics and externally or environmen tally induced behaviors implodes in Pfiesteria's life-histories. Boundaries between organism and environment do not simply become blurred, but rather the entire process of boundary construction has to be reconfigured in order to account for the entanglements within Pfiesteria's life-histories.     Barad's notion of 'intra-activity' provides the key to such a recon figuration. In contrast to interactions that suggest connections between independent entities, intra-actions draw attention to the inseparability of individual (human or nonhuman) agencies, conventionally called 'subjects' and 'objects', 'bodies' and 'environment' prior to experimental enactments. Independent of specific material meaning-making apparatuses toxic Pfiesteria  remain indeterminate. 'Bodies do not simply take their place in the world. They are not simply situated in, or located in, particular environments. Rather "environments" and "bodies" are intra-actively co-constituted'  (Barad, 2007: 170).      In addition to an inseparability of 'organism' and 'environment', spatial (synchronic) and temporal (diachronic) changes in Pfiesteria's life-histories are thoroughly intertwined. There is no moment in time in which Pfiesteria could be captured in their entirety. Thus, part of the conundrum that drives the controversy, I suggest, is that the questions 'who Pfiesteria piscicida are' and 'what toxic Pfiesteria do' are inseparably entangled. Pfiesteria's beings and doings are complementary in the Bohrian sense, that is, mutually exclusive and simultaneously necessary to assess Pfiesteria as fish killers.14 In other words, the entanglement of Pfiesteria's beings and doings attest to an inherent indeterminacy. Unlike epistemological uncertainties that refer to 'gaps' in or incompleteness of human knowledges and allegedly inhibit environmental decision-makings, this indeterminacy is an ontological notion.15 It is not due to the limitation of 'our' knowledge, but concerns the spatiotemporal  inseparability of 'intra-acting components' within Pfiesteria's life histories. The indeterminacy between Pfiesteria's beings and doings not only affects  the 'what' of their 'being now', but extends across spaces and times. It is not only that their ontology is indeterminate; rather, ontology itself is put into question and hence becomes phantomatic.      In contrast to a lack of certainty in human knowledges that presumes an a priori distinction between knowledges that must change in time and an object of inquiry that, without history or agency, has no means of vary  ing, this ontological indeterminacy affirms Pfiesteria's contributions to  their own materializations. Such an indeterminacy can be ignored but it cannot be removed; it is due to Pfiesteria's material agency, not only to react to an environment, but also to co-produce and transform 'themselves' in

relation to 'their' environment. What I call material agency16 in dino science draws from Barad's account of agency, as 'an enactment of iterative changes to particular practices ... through the dynamics of intra-activity'  (Barad, 2007: 178). Material agency is not a property of a preexisting  thing, nor an effect of human-constructed laboratory experiments in always already unified time, but needs to be taken into account 'before' certain dino features materialize.     Emphasizing the joint forces of 'nature' and 'society' in the material  ization of bodies, Barad develops her performative account of agency  through a reworking of Butler's influential theory of gender performativity which accounts for the materialization of sexed human bodies. For Butler, matter is 'a process of materialization that stabilizes over time to produce the effect of boundary, fixity, and surface we call matter' (Butler, 1993: 9). Agency lies in the possibility of reiterations left by the gap between regula  tive ideals and bodies through which norms materialize (Cheah, 1996). Barad critiques Butler's account of performativity on the grounds that matter  is figured 'as merely an end product rather than an active factor in further materializations' (Barad, 2007: 66). For my purposes here, the crucial dif ferences between these two performative notions of agency is that Butler's version hinges on a necessary incompleteness of identity formations that posits identities as future horizon or telos, while Barad relies on a funda mental indeterminacy in the 'dynamics of intra-activity'. In the absence of a product or future horizon as regulative idea, agency cannot be attributed to gaps between reiterations; the dynamics involved in intra-actions rather requires the re/constitution of time and history.     Agency is a matter of iterable intra-activity, of differance, 'history', and  'memory'. Figured as differance, as differentiation and temporization con  joined (Derrida, 1982: 8), the kinds of relationship that dynamic intra activities enable remain inherently indeterminate through space and time.  'History' here does not denote a march of human knowledges towards bet ter understandings of passive objects, nor does it come always already syn chronized as 'joint historicity of humans and nonhumans' (Latour, 2002: 265), rather it entails a 'coming to terms with the agency of the "objects"  studied' (Haraway, 1991: 198) without guarantee that the 'name of an action' will ever transition to a 'name of a thing' at the end of a research tra jectory (Latour, 1999: 147). An accounting for Pfiesteria's material agency is therefore indissociably linked to a reconfiguration of time and causality.
Without Fish There Is No Fish Killer What is most remarkable about Pfiesteria is not only that they are capable of  spontaneous metamorphoses in response to changing environmental condi  tions, but also that such a response is triggered by the fish (presumably their  excreta) on which they then prey, altering not only their current shape, but  their entire mode of reproduction. According to Burkholder & Glasgow  (1997), many of the morphs and transformations depicted in the life cycle  above (for example, the amoebae) manifest themselves only while Pfiesteria

 are actively killing fish. There is something like a 'catch-22', regarding Pfiesteria's identification as a species and their toxicity as a characteristic property. As the authors of the Raleigh Report (1998) observe: 'An unfortu nate and unavoidable circularity exists in that the presence of fish in culture ... is needed both to stimulate and detect toxin activity, hence the stimulus cannot be measured independently of its effect.' Pfiesteria exclu sively cultured on algae prey cannot be made to kill fish. Ironically, they need the fish around in order to become their killers. Toxic Pfiesteria only  'are' in relationship to fish and specific environmental conditions. In simpler  terms: without fish there is no fish killer. If you want to know who Pfiesteria  are by themselves - if that were possible at all - you will inevitably produce nontoxic Pfiesteria, but not Pfiesteria piscicida, the fish killer.       If their becoming-toxic is part of 'who Pfiesteria are', what could it mean  to affirm 'Pfiesteria' as the causative agent of fish kills? In other words, can the entanglement between Pfiesteria's beings and doings, their species-identity and  toxicity be resolved experimentally? In Barad's agential realist account of sci  entific practices this is exactly what (objective) experiments do; they locally  resolve an inherent indeterminacy within a phenomenon, in determining the meaning of a cause in relation to its effect. The referent for such 'causal intra actions' is however not a predefined object, but the phenomenon17 within which 'agencies of observations' become differentiated from an 'object'. An unambiguous differentiation is possible only under the condition of a com plete specification of the material-discursive practices that enact what Barad calls an 'agential cut' (Barad, 2007: 140). Different 'cuts' between 'object' and 'measurement agencies' establish different phenomena. Responsibility  then entails the accounting for the practices that enact a specific cut such that objects-in-phenomena become determined, that is, materialize and matter,  and accountability to 'what is excluded from mattering' (pp. 184, 205). Mattering implies both materialization and meaning-making (Butler, 1993: 32). Hence, for Barad, scientific practices are meaning-making practices that  require accountability to what comes to exist. Responsibility and causality  condition each other. In order to accommodate Pfiesteria's specific spatiotem poral entanglements, I reformulate Barad's notion of responsibility slightly.       Considering that Pfiesteria's life-histories and toxic 'parts' thereof con  stitute an entanglement whose intra-acting 'components' are inseparable in  space and time, the joint possibility of responsibility and causality will not only depend on what materializes, but also on how such a cut is enacted in  relation to space and time. At issue is not only the mutual entanglement of   'object' and 'measurement agencies', but also the enactment of their inter dependent historicities. In other words, responsible enactments of toxic Pfiesteria will have to take Pfiesteria's contribution to their experimental materialization into account. As soon as Pfiesteria's agencies and history dependency are accounted for, that is, the capability to dynamically change  the relationship between 'self and 'environment', we are no longer dealing with an indeterminacy that could be resolved in laboratory time. The ghostly undecidability that asserts Pfiesteria's material agency precludes deterministic cause and effect relations in general.

      In the following sections, I discuss various experimental enactments of Pfiesteria that either: (1) ignore Pfiesteria's contributions to experimental  intra-actions; (2) reduce them to context-dependencies and thus oppose Pfiesteria's doings and beings; or (3) take the entanglement of Pfiesteria's history- and context-dependency into account, but leave Pfiesteria's being  indeterminate. Assuming different meanings of toxicity and its relationship  to causality, discrepant experimental enactments of Pfiesteria delimit their response-ability in various ways.
Toxicity as Absent Property of Atemporal Objects Fiercely disputing Burkholder's finding, Litaker et al., a group of scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), pro pose a much simpler life cycle for Pfiesteria. Presuming that ca species life cycle is one of the most fundamental and conservative traits intrinsic to that organism5 (Litaker et al., 2002b: 1268), the researchers set out to establish  an 'unambiguous identification of Ppiscicida life cycle stages5 (Litaker et al., 2002a: 443). After a careful literature review establishing the possible stages of a typical dino life cycle that exhibits both asexual and sexual modes of  reproduction, Litaker et al. confirm the existence of similar stages in the Pfiesteria life cycle with the help of a new genetic technology. Since genetic probes - or more accurately, those genetic probes that mark a specific ribo  somal gene region used for Pfiesteria species identification (Tengs et al., 2003) - cannot discriminate between toxic and non-toxic Pfiesteria, the  researchers assume that Pfiesteria's lethal relation to fish is irrelevant to the   'being5 of Pfiesteria. To them, what looks like Pfiesteria before the experi ment becomes Pfiesteria after the experiment. The difference is a new molecular visualization technology for identity production, establishing genetic relationships with in situ fluorescent-labeled peptide nucleic acid probes (PNAs).18 Trying to sort out which of the dino morphs they encounter belong to genetically defined Pfiesteria and which are sup posedly contaminations (organisms belonging to a different species), the researchers let Pfiesteria-specific PNA probes penetrate various 'life-stages5, such that the fluorescent molecules light up pieces of ribosomal RNA with which the probes are designed to hybridize. Litaker et al. (2002a) present various pictures of dino cells with glowing (in red or green) spots in their bodies and amoebae that don't glow when exposed to Pfiesteria-spccific probes. Assuming that a genetic relationship, or the lack thereof, between Pfiesteria zoospores and amoebae found in fish aquaria would be indicative of Pfiesteria's toxicity, Litaker proclaims, 'Toxic Pfiesteria life cycle stages that don't exist can't be toxic5 (Litaker, quoted in Dewar, 2002).19 Burkholder and Glasgow (2002: 1265) object that 'they did not show that their strains were killing fish'. Throughout their paper, which the media and a number of scientific reviewers quickly cited as evidence against Pfiesteria's toxicity, Litaker et al. (2002a) state that their clonal Pfiesteria cultures were  'maintained on algae or fish', without specifying which of the glowing

morphs corresponds to which cultural condition. For the NOAA team, Pfiesteria are fully determined by a correspondence between genes and a particular mode of reproduction. Such a mapping becomes possible when Pfiesteria's material agency is erased. In Litaker et al.'s hands, Pfiesteria becomes an atemporal object, which can be genetically identified, but will not be toxic to fish. Not having been able to observe those life stages described as specific to Pfiesteria-fish intra-actions, the authors conclude,  'Consequently, any ecological role or potential toxicity ascribed to these  specious Ppiscicida stages should be reexamined' (2002a: 462). Thus, for Litaker et al., toxicity is a property of specific life stages, which must mani fest themselves independently of the experimental circumstances, in par  ticular independently of specific culture conditions and Pfiesteria's activity towards fish.      Rather than searching for specific life stages, another research team, Berry et al., looks for genes encoding for substances (polyketide synthase)  typical of those found in other toxin-producing dinoflagellates. Unable to find evidence for the existence of these genes within Pfiesteria's genome, they conclude that Pfiesteria kill fish, but are not toxic to fish. For Berry et al. (2002: 10972), the demonstration of toxicity 'requires that chemical constituents capable of causing the attributed effect(s) can be isolated from the suspected source ... and subsequently shown to induce the same effect  in vitro'. Their notion of toxicity assumes causality to constitute a substan tive relationship between predefined objects mediated by a chemical sub stance. Both the organism as producer and the toxin as transmitter have to exist as bounded entities independent of the circumstances of their produc tion. 'The root error', as philosopher Joe Rouse puts it, 'is the presumption that the world somehow already comes naturally composed of discrete objects' (Rouse, 2002: 313).     Both research teams assume that toxicity must be locatable somewhere within the genetically defined organism. Their search for an inherent toxic property simultaneously presumes a specific notion of causality and pre cludes its establishment. The assumption that a potential for toxicity is given by an essential characteristic inherent to dinos as established by past research on other dinos requires that its expression be independent of envi ronmental circumstances and its effects. Thus, if toxicity were to exist, it must be independent of the environmental circumstances that bring it about. In erasing the means of variation in Pfiesteria under altered experi mental and environmental circumstances, the existence of toxic Pfiesteria is precluded by design. The possibility that Pfiesteria's doings affect their beings is simply ignored. What remains is the universalization of unspeci fied particular contexts 'unable to be called into account' (Haraway, 1991:  191). In this way, responsibility in experimentation is effaced in both senses of term: in recreating that which was presupposed, the experiments con struct the essence of Pfiesteria's beings as atemporal object, foreclosing the dinos' ability to respond and presume that any evidence for Pfiesteria's tox  icity requires universal validity that by definition forestalls responsibility.

Irrelevant 'Core' Reproductive Processes: A Fluid Compromise? Since it seems to be impossible to follow Pfiesteria around in a controlled manner and in 'contaminant-free' cultures while they are killing fish, Parrow et al. (2002) propose that there may be 'core (common) reproduc tive processes exhibited by Pfiesteria spp. zoospores that are largely con served, regardless of prey type availability and toxicity status'. The authors caution, however, that the significance of their life cycle studies should not be overestimated:
    For this study, the need for controlled, contaminant-free cultures with     benthic encysted and planktonic stages that could be readily observed     under microscopy outweighed the increased ecological relevance possible      in fish-fed, actively toxic cultures. Although caution is warranted in over      extrapolation of the importance of research conducted using Pfiesteria spp.      cultures that have been maintained solely on a diet of algal prey for extended     periods (weeks to months), those concerns extend primarily to issues of     toxicity and nutrient pollution. (Parrow et al., 2002: 7)
Here, Parrow et al. seem to be pitching the need for reproducibility and con  trolled experimentation that would allow for 'inferences for [Pfiesteria's]  classification' against the ecological relevance of experiments investigating Pfiesteria's toxicity. In contrast to Litaker et al., who sample their aquaria periodically and match the life-stages found to a schema reconstructed from the dino literature, Parrow et al. follow Pfiesteria's developments. In order to do so, they have to pick a beginning in the (life) cycle and make the cells per form in unified time freed from intra-actions with prey. Motile dino cells were isolated from other developmental stages just after they transformed from benthic cysts such that 'flagellated cells excysted into media devoid of prey' (Parrow et al., 2002: 9). By erasing the poly-temporality within the col  lection of morphs, the experimenters attempt to make Pfiesteria's develop ments become traceable in laboratory time. Pfiesteria's agencies are not entirely erased as in the case of the atemporal objects discussed above, rather possible variations are circumscribed by specific technologies employed, severely limiting Pfiesteria's response-ability. Ecological relevance is not excluded a priori because the focus is on stability and reproducibility, but rather because reproducibility involves a process of synchronization that makes the 'cells live differently in time' (Landecker, 2005).     For Parrow et al. the question is not 'what the true life cycle of Pfiesteria piscicida really is' (Coats, 2002).Their approach suggests instead that there might be 'different versions of the object' (Mol, 1999: 77). The researchers maintain that '[ajlthough the cell division of a given dinoflagellate species has been regarded a conserved character (often used as taxonomic trait) ...  it is possible that Pfiesteria also exhibits variability in cell division' (Parrow  et al., 2002: 23). Perhaps this is what Law and Singleton (2005) mean when they speak of a 'fluid object': relations that make up the core repro ductive processes change in time and reshape the object when environ mental and laboratory circumstances are altered.

    By taking into account the circumstances that bring the classifiable dinos about, the scientists could be seen as being accountable for connec tions made and particular exclusions enacted. While Parrow et al. consider the possibility that changes in Pfiesteria's life cycle may occur under altered nutritional or ecological conditions, they do not consider that the synchro nization process, which establishes Pfiesteria's temporality as traceable in laboratory time, erases the nutritional histories on which Pfiesteria's becoming-toxic depends. Toxicity cannot modify life cycle processes over time that only exist under the condition that toxicity is excluded. It is not that toxic Pfiesteria remain indeterminate; rather toxicity becomes impossi ble to affirm. The very assumption of the existence of a conserved entity before Pfiesteria become toxic in their encounter with fish precludes a link between Pfiesteria and toxic Pfiesteria. Thus, what Parrow et al. consider experimentation in a 'highly artificial environment' and perhaps irrelevant for ecological processes, is not irrelevant for the possibility of toxic Pfiesteria at all - such an environment precludes their existence.     Parrow et al.'s affirmation of a stable 'core' in Pfiesteria's species-being thus depicts potentially toxic Pfiesteria maintained with fish as both a tem poral modification of classifiable Pfiesteria and ontologically distinct from them, namely, that which is necessarily excluded from experiments with algae-fed Pfiesteria. The indeterminacy between Pfiesteria's beings and doings is not resolved, but rather affirmed as oxymoron. When Pfiesteria's nutritional history-dependency and with it Pfiesteria's contributions to material agencies are erased, their beings and doings remain opposed within an ecological space that cannot vary in pre-established laboratory time. The significance of core-reproductive processes is established through responsibility towards a particular mode of experimentation, emphasizing contaminant-free culture, and easy reproducibility, thus enabling inferences for Pfiesteria's classification. Thus, limiting their responsibility towards a  'past' of established scientific practices, the researchers minimize Pfiesteria's ability to respond (their response-ability).     As one dino taxonomist notes, 'it is perhaps obvious that a full knowl edge of the life cycle of a particular species is critical in order to determine its appropriate placement in the overall scheme of the group as a whole'  (Fensome et al., 1999). Steidinger et al. (1996) invented a new family (Pfiesteriaceae) > genus (Pfiesteria) and species (Pfiesteria piscicida) for the fish killers. Without connection to anything established, a new species, genus, and family would cease to be meaningful. Anything 'new' must be both familiar and revolutionary, related to the 'past' and radically breaking with it (Derrida, 1988; see also Jasanoff, 2005). The fact that anything 'new' is necessarily aporetic has not prevented scientists from establishing classifica tions in the past. No classification is innocent, as an extensive literature in Science Studies has shown (Foucault, 1970; Ritvo, 1997; Bowker & Star, 1999; Waterton, 2002; Bowker, 2005; Sommerlund, 2006). Different kinds of classification embed different kinds of priorities and values. But the situ ation is slightly different here. Pfiesteria's appearances are not merely 'under determined by nature and logic alone' (Shackley & Wynne, 1995: 124),
                               This content downloaded from              23.165.184.40 on Mon, 13 Oct 2025 08:35:24 UTC                        All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms                                                           290 Social Studies of Science 40/2
a situation that requires scientific assessment about relevant stabilities. Pfiesteria do not acquire a stable identity or species-being that could be abstracted from the conditions of their production (see Helmreich, 2009, for related arguments). It is not only that Pfiesteria are 'hard to classify'; they  are rather unclassifiable as long as classification requires the existence of sta ble properties independent of specific relations between space and time. As Geoffrey Bowker points out, 'when time itself is a dynamic variable then the naming mechanisms tend to break down' (2005: 145).Thus the main issue here is not so much the politics in classification or the co-existence of mul  tiple classification schemes (Sommerlund, 2006), but the politics of classifi  cation, that is, the perceived requirement of sorting out the 'taxonomic background' as prerequisite for further investigating into Pfiesteria's behav  iors. The phantomatic character of the dinos disrupts the entire logic of tax onomy. Toxic phantom dinos shatter the self-evidence of'our' time.      To summarize, as long as Pfiesteria piscicida is considered the name of  a species that can be unambiguously characterized by a life cycle and/or genetic probes, toxic Pfiesteria remain precluded; they are neither an eco  logical subset nor a temporal variation of the species, but both at the same  time. In other words, as long as the species is assumed to exist prior to toxic Pfiesteria, toxic Pfiesteria incorporate 'two fundamentally incommensurable ontologies' (Bowker, 2005: 186).    Before re/turning to the phantomatic fish killer, whose experimental enactment in the hands of Burkholder et al. does not presuppose an atem poral essence or a core existence that may vary in linear time, a few remarks about discrepant meanings of toxicity employed by the various research teams are in order, as slipperiness in the usage of the term 'toxicity' seems to conceal the fact that the controversy is about the meaning of causality.
Discrepant Meanings of Toxicity and their Relation to Causality The scientists' incoherent and sometimes interchangeable usage of the terms 'toxicity', sometimes referring to 'toxi(co)genicity' (producing toxins), and other times to 'ichthyotoxicity' (fish killing) may have contributed a great deal to the controversy over Pfiesteria's 'toxicity'. Various articulations of toxicity imply different notions of causality. While 'ichthyotoxicity' is clearly defined as detrimental to fish, toxi(co)genicity implies the produc  tion of a neurotoxin that may also be harmful to humans in addition to fish. The more important distinction for my purposes is that the former suggests  toxicity as a harmful or deadly relationship, whereas the latter associates  toxicity with an inherent property. Toxicogenicity as employed by Berry et al.  (2002) locates the 'cause' of a toxic relationship within the producer of a  toxin, which by definition already contains its effect, rendering causality a deterministic relationship. Ichthyotoxicity, conversely, focuses on the effect of a toxic relationship, the dead fish. A cause is then defined as that which can repeatedly induce the same effect. Within that definition, ichthyotoxicity receives two distinct meanings depending on whether toxicity is associated

with a stable relationship or a 'dynamic activity'. In the former case the existence of well-defined relata is presupposed, such that a 'causal agent' can be isolated from its effect after the fact and retrospectively defined as that which precedes it. How it might be possible to affirm Pfiesteria's toxicity without presupposing the existence of a causal agent and render experimen tation more response-able at the same time is the topic of the rest of this paper. As already suggested, this will entail a reconfiguration of both the notion of'dynamics' and of'activity'. First, however, I discuss a protocol for the experimental establishment of causality - when not associated with the production of a toxin - that most dino researchers sought to follow.
Koch Postulates The 'Koch's Postulates' are a series of guidelines developed in the late 19th century by German bacteriologist Robert Koch (1843-1910) as a standard for evidence of causation in infectious diseases (Evans, 1976). While their  limitations have long been recognized, the 'Koch Postulates' are still con  sidered the 'gold standard' for causative agency in epidemiology.20 For a microorganism to count as the cause of a specific disease, the following four criteria must be fulfilled:21
   Postulate 1: The infectious organism must be present in the diseased host.    Postulate 2: The organism must be isolated from the host and grown in    pure culture.    Postulate 3: The pure culture must be shown to induce the disease anew:     the isolated organism must be injected into a healthy host and infect the    host again.    Postulate 4: The agent must be re-isolated from the experimentally infected    animal and shown to be the same as the previously isolated organism.
These Postulates are designed to assess retrospectively whether a given  infectious organism has caused a disease. The requirements of the organ  ism's isolatability and stability presume that what constitutes the organism must be already established and independent of the capability to infect the host. The requirement for 'pure culture' assumes that infection happens under all circumstances independent of any environmental variations.     None of these requirements apply to Pfiesteria as described above. Since toxicity in Pfiesteria is triggered by fish, it cannot be assumed to exist before Pfiesteria are exposed to fish. Moreover, Pfiesteria are not 'present' in the fish, and toxic zoospores can be found in water samples only as long as fish are dying. Soon after fish death, many zoospores transform into benign cysts, which makes it difficult to catch toxic Pfiesteria 'in the act'. Potentially toxic zoospores cannot be entirely isolated from other organisms since endosymbiotic bacteria survive as functional energy reserves in their 'bellies', producing nutrition photosynthetically when necessary. Pfiesteria zoospores cannot be grown in pure culture since they need to be fed in order to prolif erate (Burkholder et al., 2001b). Moreover, healthy fish rarely come alone;

 they are accompanied by a microbial consortium that cannot be removed without changing the very meaning of'health5 or 'life5 in fish.22 More impor tantly, however, the boundary between 'organism5 and 'host5, or between potentially toxic Pfiesteria and their environment does not sit still in the transition from live to dead fish. The kind of population of zoospores that may have killed the fish will no longer exist after the fish are dead. When becoming-toxic, individual morphs change shape and reproduce quickly.     Thus, the two main requirements for causality as postulated by Koch repetition of the 'infection5 and stability of identity between iterations - are mutually exclusive. Does that mean that causality is in principle impossible to establish? As argued above, the species Pfiesteria piscicida and toxic Pfiesteria cannot receive meaning at the same time; the experimental cir cumstances for their enactment are complementary. The relation between Pfiesteria piscicida and toxic Pfiesteria is one of differance: toxic Pfiesteria dif fer from and defer their species-being. So far I have discussed attempts at identification that precluded the assessment of toxicity and the possibility of a causal relation between Pfiesteria and dead fish. Now, I turn to exper  iments that focus on the repeatability of Pfiesteria's toxic activities, without establishing exactly who Pfiesteria are.
Experimenting with the Toxic Pfiesteria Complex: Relating Responsibility as Response-ability to Causality as Inheritance Burkholder et al.5s adaptations of the Koch Postulates 'for toxic rather than  infectious agents5 entail a reworking of the notion of causality. In order to affirm what is measured and causally connected, a new terminology was required. Burkholder et al. avoid speaking of toxicity as a contingent char acteristic of the species Pfiesteria piscicida. Her laboratory rather affirms the toxicity of Ffiesteria-like organisms (PLOs)23 that will have become mem bers of the toxic Pfiesteria complex, according to their lethal performance in standardized fish bioassays. The experiments define toxic Pfiesteria dynam  ically through deadly intra-actions with certain kinds of fish. Burkholder et al. (2001a) distinguish three agential types of toxic Pfiesteria: 'strains5 that are either actively toxic, potentially toxic, or non-inducible. The last of these can no longer be made to kill fish, whereas the first two are distin guished by how fast and often they kill fish. 'Time to fish death5 is taken as a measure of the kind of toxicity.      Before Pfiesteria are found in action killing fish, it remains inherently undecidable whether the toxicity of a particular 'strain5 refers to how they have been acting or to how they will be acting towards fish. Pfiesteria's capa bility to act differently depending on their nutritional histories not only affirms an indeterminacy between 'organism5 and 'environment5, but also between 'past5 and 'future5 activities.      How Pfiesteria have been acting in the 'field5 can only be inferred from how they continue to act under comparable conditions in endless repetition of the entire procedure. Since toxic Pfiesteria are defined as being able to kill

fish, they can only be assumed to 'be' of the same kind if they continue to be able to kill fish. In general, it is inherently undecidable whether Pfiesteria's toxicity is occurring for the first time or whether it is coming back. Like a Derridean specter, Pfiesteria's toxicity begins by coming back.24 Toxic Pfiesteria neither precede nor follow their traces.     How then can any relations between the deadly activities in laboratory fish tanks and fish kills in the estuaries be established? In other words, how can the indeterminacy between 'past' and 'future' in Pfiesteria's toxic activ ities be resolved? In Barad's reconfiguration of causality as iterative intra activity, component 'parts' of a phenomenon become differentiated only under the condition of a complete specification of the experimental (mate  rial and discursive) circumstances through which a mark on a 'measure ment agency' (the dying fish) receives meaning as 'effect' of a measured object. Pfiesteria do not pre-exist 'their' toxic relationship to fish; toxic Pfiesteria receive meaning only if the 'intra-actions exhibit repeatable pat  terns' (Rouse, 2002: 279). A repetition of the toxic phenomenon is, how ever, as we will see, precisely what renders an unambiguous differentiation between Pfiesteria and their environment impossible. Part of the problem is that Pfiesteria are not only context-, but also history-dependent, in which case we are dealing with an entanglement of two indeterminacies - between  'bodies' and 'environment' and 'past' and 'future' - that cannot be resolved at the same time. As soon as a 'time' as an external parameter that auto matically orders events chronologically can no longer be presupposed, the differentiation between 'bodies' and 'environment' depends on what I call  temporalization - the establishment of a relation between 'past' and 'future'.
The Fish Bioassays The fish bioassays are designed to distinguish whether Pfiesteria that are able to continue to kill fish in the laboratory have been actively toxic in the  field. This becomes possible because the time of separation from proximity  to fish critically influences their further ability to kill fish. Actively toxic zoospores rapidly form cysts, but 'resume lethal activity toward test fish within 4 to 9 days. ... Populations that were not previously in actively toxic mode require considerably longer to kill fish in bioassays (typically 6-8 weeks or more)' (Burkholder et al., 2001b). Pfiesteria have a 'biochemical "memory" for recent stimulation by live fish' (Pfiesteria Interagency Coordination Workgroup, 2000). Here, 'memory' cannot be thought of as an intrinsic property of Pfiesteria; it cannot be localized internally to an organism and determined by a genetic sequence. As co-constitutive part of agency, Pfiesteria's memory manifests itself in response to fish; it doesn't precede but conditions their intra-activity with fish. Memory is not a matter of the past, but re-creates a past each time it is invoked.25     In the following procedure described by Burkholder et al., timings are  important at every step. The requirement of the Koch Postulates for 'pre sence of the organism in the host' is replaced with an observation of a mini mum density of flagellated dino morphs that under a light microscope look

 like Pfiesteria zoospores. The 'host' is a water sample collected from an estu ary where/while a fish kill is still in process. In the laboratory, the water samples are incubated with healthy fish. If the fish continue to die, the water samples are said to contain 'an actively ichthyotoxic population of zoospores resembling Pfiesteria' (Burkholder et al., 2001b: 747). From this population of Pfiesteria-like organisms that have been killing fish a subpop ulation that still look like Pfiesteria zoospores when analyzed with the enhanced resolution of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are isolated from the rest of the water sample and made to reproduce with algae-prey until they acquire a critical zoospore density.      In a 'renewed induction of the disease', algae-cultured Pfiesteria zoospores are incubated with healthy fish (accompanied by a consortium of other microbes) and the time to fish death is observed as an initial measure of toxicity. In order to remain actively toxic, the dinos have to be continu ously fed with fish. Dead fish in the aquaria have to be replaced with healthy fish. 'Time to fish death' depends on 'the rate of zoospore popula tion increase', which in turn depends on the frequency of fish replacements (Glasgow et al., 2001). In addition, it depends on Pfiesteria's memory of their previous exposure to fish and therefore varies with every iteration. Since Pfiesteria's 'past' relation to fish receives meaning only through the possibility of multiple iterations, enabling Pfiesteria to continue to act, the relationship between toxic Pfiesteria and fish is not causally fixable at any moment in time.     A second iteration changes not only the 'time to fish death', but also the relation between Pfiesteria zoospores and their environment. Control fish cultures that receive algae prey without Pfiesteria may delineate Pfiesteria zoospores from their environment before zoospores are exposed to fish. If maintained under equivalent conditions, the control experiments could define toxic Pfiesteria as that which is absent in those aquaria in which fish stay healthy compared with the content of the aquaria in which fish will die. However, as soon as the putative cause receives meaning in relation to its effect - that is, as soon as a population of zoospores begins killing fish - the population of toxic Pfiesteria changes both in number (through enhanced  fish-assisted reproduction) and kind (through metamorphoses). What may have been contributing to toxicity during a previous kill may now be part of  'its' environment. Repetition of the toxic phenomenon thus continuously modifies the boundary between the putative fish killer and 'its' environment.     As described so far, the situation seems hopelessly circular, and causality, even in Barad's reformulation, seems to be precluded. An unambiguous determination of a boundary between 'object' and 'measurement agency' or, in this case, between 'Pfiesteria' and 'their environment' would be pos sible only if repetition would not alter this boundary. The failure to unam biguously enact toxic Pfiesteria in the fish bioassays dramatizes what Derrida suggests for all kinds of objects: the 'same' object is only determinable as the same through its alteration (see Derrida, 1988). What seems to be a paradoxical statement might just be matter of our preconceptions of time. A corollary to the 'root error' that assumes the world is composed of

discrete entities is the assumption that time is 'made up of successive linking of presents identical to themselves' (Derrida, 1994: 70).     Repeatability here is better understood in Derrida's terms as 'iterability', which suggests that the very possibility of appearance of a 'mark' as objective measurement result entails its temporalization, that is, the 'object' must be able to continue to act in the absence of its condition of produc tion, whereas any reiteration introduces a difference that undermines its supposed identity. In this way, iterability is constitutive of every mark or object. The point here is not, as Butler's regulative account of performativ  ity may suggest, that the mark must be repeated in order to be effective, rather a mark only exists as a mark if repeatability inheres in it.     For Barad, 'causality is an entangled affair: it is a matter of cutting things together and apart' (Barad, 2007: 394). While 'cutting apart' refers to the differentiation between 'object' and 'measurement agencies' within a phenomenon, an agential cutting-together is a process that extends the entanglement of a specific phenomenon. In my reading of the Pfiesteria experiments, this 'cutting-together' becomes a process of temporalization when it relates histories of traces or memories of past relations rather than things. For Barad, an extension of an entanglement engenders a 'new' phe nomenon. In my account, this cutting-together constitutes a temporaliza tion as the condition of possibility of the appearance of the phenomenon. In joining differentiation with temporalization, I hold on to an undecidabil  ity between 'the original' and 'the new'. Temporalization extends a phe nomenon through 'time'. However, as long as temporalization presupposes differentiation as a possibility of repetition that guarantees identity prior to the actual repetitions it makes possible, causality as intra-activity is pre cluded. In other words, temporalization cannot be thought of on the basis of a beginning, an origin, or cause as a discrete event that has been present in the 'past'.     What turns out to be repeatable in these experiments is neither the  'time to fish death' nor the delineation of a 'causative agent' as separable difference from its environment, but a temporal pattern - where the relation between first time and second time to fish death are of particular impor  tance (Burkholder et al., 2001b: 755) - of continued deadly activity towards fish under specific environmental conditions such as water temper ature, salinity, pH, oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphate content, and so on.     The results of fish assays do not establish an unambiguous cause of the fish kills in terms of origin, producer, or identity, but the environmental conditions under which 'Pfiesteria' are able to continue to act, as conditions of possibility for fish kills in the field. In order to establish causality, the environmental parameters must fulfill two complementary requirements: they must be able to relate actively toxic Pfiesteria in the laboratory fish tanks to a particular fish kill in the field, that is, temporalize the toxic phenomenon; and they must ensure the repeatability of this relation for a particular set of fish assays.      In order to relate actively toxic Pfiesteria in the laboratory to a particular  fish kill in the field, the environmental and experimental conditions can

neither be arbitrary nor prescribed as fixed (for example, by measured  condition in the field after the fish are dead). They must be both sufficiently  constraining, simulating field conditions that are 'conducive to toxic Pfiesteria growth', and flexible enough such that Pfiesteria's contributions to  the temporal pattern of consecutive fish kills continue to matter. Only if the  conditions allow for Pfiesteria's memory of previous exposures to fish to  influence these patterns is it possible to distinguish between toxic Pfiesteria  that have been active in the field and those enticed to kill fish in laboratory without memory of previous exposure to fish. If Pfiesteria's activities would  just follow the rhythms in which healthy fish are made available, the times  to fish death would provide no clue about possible activities in the field. What is required are conditions that enable an intra-active synchronization between Pfiesteria's memory and the frequency of the fish-replacement, which manifests itself (paradoxically) in the temporal variability of Pfiesteria's response to fish in every iteration.      As soon as the 'object of study' contributes to its own materialization, a cause can no longer precede its effect in linear externalized time. And, as soon as temporal homogeneity can no longer be presupposed - that is, when  'components' of a phenomenon are activities that cannot be assumed to already cohere in time - agential differentiations must be accompanied by temporalization - an intra-active process of synchronization. Synchronization here does not entail the adjustment or maladjustment of an intrinsic time of the body to the time of the experimental apparatuses - a situation that Bowker and Star refer to as 'torqued' (1999). Rather, it is itself an intra activity composed of temporally heterogeneous activities, enabling the reconstitution of time in the deadly marking of fish. In short, the environ mental conditions must be determined in such a way that Pfiesteria's toxic activities in the laboratory are assertable as the future trace of a specific  'past' fish kill in the field. The 'past' of a fish kill in the field is neither pro duced nor reproduced in the laboratory, but inherited. Inheritance brings forth a past that has never been present as future trace through intra-active  synchronization of multiple activities, which becomes possible only under  relevant environmental and experimental conditions that render the exper  iments repeatable.      Repeatability of the fish bioassays entails the adjustment of environ mental conditions allowing for Pfiesteria's continued toxic response to fish  such that they become conditions of possibility for fish kills in the estuar  ies to which Pfiesteria zoospores will have contributed. A successful repe  tition of the experiments then ensures that these conditions are relevant for an assessment of the link between toxic Pfiesteria and the nutrient pol  lution in the estuaries.26 In other words, getting the experiments to work  responsibly and repeatedly requires attention to the agencies of the object of study - the maintenance of Pfiesteria's response-ability - which in turn necessitates the inclusion of particular matters of concern27 - the condition  that will have enabled particular fish kills in the field - as part of the objec  tive referent, which also establish the ecological and political relevance of  the experiments.

   While Pfiesteria's history-dependency ensures that their being is constitutively deferred, undermining any attempt to fully identify Pfiesteria, it enables a temporal 'connection' between /yzesrma-associated laboratory killings and a particular fish kill in the field. Pfiesteria's memory does not change in time, but changes time itself. The time reconstituted through inheritance cannot simply be reinserted into a causal chain as an additional element, rather it becomes topical - a 'chronotope' in Haraway's (1997: 41) terms - where 'topos' does not simply refer to a place but to a site of engagement or a matter of concern.      Causality as iterable intra-activity thus becomes an inheritance that  temporalizes the phenomenon in 'cutting together' deadly traces and hinges on the inclusion of specific matters of concern as part of the experimental referent, which renders the experiments repeatable. The fish bioassays don't establish an event that closes a gap between a preconceived 'before' and 'after'. They don't provide the 'missing link' that transforms aspects of the species Pfiesteria piscicida into toxic Pfiesteria; rather they demonstrate  that toxic Pfiesteria have always already been killing fish. Actively toxic Pfiesteria will have been able to kill fish in the field if 'future' generations continue to kill fish in the laboratory.     Membership in the Toxic Pfiesteria Complex is thus not established by any particular presence, but through a continued ability to respond to and kill fish. Pfiesteria's being remains phantomatic. Phantoms always begin in repetition. A phantom is however not simply something that comes and goes, which could be captured scientifically with appropriate timings and  improved sampling methods; it cannot be represented or made present; it rather challenges the 'synchrony of the living present' (Derrida, 1982). But a phantom leaves a trace, making demands on us to be accounted for, to be taken into account.     Responsibility then entails not responding to a particular other, who does not exist as such,28 but the enabling of responsiveness within particular relatings, which in turn enables and necessitates accountability to an  'extended' phenomenon, that is, to what is at stake in getting the experi ments to work. In other words, the epistemic/ontological concern of getting  the experiments to work in a reliable manner cannot be dissociated from the ecological/political relevance within responsible practices. How toxic Pfiesteria are enacted is thoroughly entangled with what comes to matter for environmental decision-making.
Critiques of the Fish Bioassays The existence of a multi-species microbial community in the fish aquaria has led to criticism of the fish bioassays as a suitable tool to establish causality between Pfiesteria and dead fish. Since the fish bioassays cannot draw an unambiguous boundary between Pfiesteria and their environment, they cannot distinguish whether toxicity is generated by Pfiesteria-like organisms 'or a result of interactive processes within the complex microbial community' (Gordon & Dyer, 2005: 429). Some researchers suspect that

interactions between Pfiesteria and bacteria that either come with the fish or live within certain Pfiesteria stages might be important for toxin produc tion (Burkholder et al., 2005). The experiments also do not distinguish whether a water-soluble toxin ultimately kills the fish or whether the fish die from physical attacks by the dinos. These are important open questions, but they do not render the kind of causality established with fish bioassays more uncertain. The matters of concern are different. In particular, inves tigations of the involvement and effects of a neurotoxin are of great impor tance when it comes to the assessment of human health risks. In the fish bioassays, the concerns are explicitly with dead fish and the environmental conditions that enable the kills. Dead fish cannot (directly) stand in for human health risks. While the fish bioassays might provide clues about pos sible means to prevent massive fish kills, they do not allow for an assessment of the dangers to human health after the fact. There is no guarantee that the kind of causality the fish bioassays establish makes a difference for envi ronmental policies, but perhaps it can change the terms of the negotiations from deferrals due to alleged uncertainties towards arguments over specific matters of concern.
Concluding Remarks The quest to remove uncertainties, 'gaps' in knowledge, and 'missing links'  in a causal chain has presumed (without specifying) that what counts as  evidence for the establishment of Pfiesteria's toxicity is independent of the  experimental questions asked. In each of the cases discussed, what counts as evidence for Pfiesteria's toxicity, their life cycle and possible links between the two, has become part of the experimental apparatus. Who Pfiesteria are and what toxic Pfiesteria could possibly become crucially depend on the  'how' of their enactment.     Discrepant enactments of Pfiesteria's life histories and toxicity are not a matter of epistemological uncertainties or opposing views. Nor did the researchers construct different versions of the object 'toxic Pfiesteria' that would be simply incomparable. Rather, various laboratory practices have enacted different kinds of objects - the atemporal genetic Pfiesteria, the fluid object of reproductive processes, and a phantom - exhibiting various degrees of responsibility in enabling and disabling responsiveness. The dif ferences are thus neither epistemological, concerning different perspectives onto the same object, nor ontological, in the sense that multiple ontologies co-exist at the same time (Mol, 2002). Rather, differences here concern the variability of relations through and between space and time. In other words, experimental determinations don't just constitute 'subjects' and 'objects', but constitute such divisions in specific spatiotemporal relationships. It is the kind of relationship that matters.     The fish bioassays, I have argued, affirm causality as responsible  inheritance; they are both responsible in enabling Pfiesteria's continued response-ability and necessarily relevant to particular matters of environ mental concern. These experiments not only account for Pfiesteria's toxic  inheritances from field to laboratory, but also constitute an inheritance of

a specific scientific practice. The Koch Postulates are neither rejected nor literally followed, but materially reconfigured - that is, inherited. The inde terminacy between Pfiesteria's being and doings is not resolved but is rather affirmed as entanglement. Pfiesteria's being is not opposable to their doings; it rather remains indeterminate, when the circumstances of 'their' bioactivity are measured. This ontological indeterminacy establishes the very condition of possibility for objective and responsible scientific practice. The members of the Toxic Pfiesteria Complex are phantomatic; their being remains 'to come'. A move from 'being' as a ground in ontology towards a phantomatic ontology, as the condition for responsible and objective science, is not a move from 'being' to 'doings' or 'becomings', rather their relationship itself remains inherently indeterminate and must be reconfigured in every intra-act through specific matters of concern.     Phantoms share with 'fire objects' the acknowledgement that not everything can be brought to presence, but that doesn't turn them into 'a pattern of presences and absences' (Law & Singleton, 2005: 343). Phantoms don't follow the rules of a dialectic that can conceive of difference only as absence; they are neither present nor absent, but spectral, internally split,  'non-contemporary' with themselves (Derrida, 1994: xix), or in Bohrian  terms, they are complementary to themselves. Phantoms share with Rheinberger's 'epistemic things' that they are constitutively deferred; their embodiments are their traces. These traces, however, are not 'transformed as time goes on'; phantoms do not become what they have been (Rheinberger, 1997: 181); rather than recurrent, Pfiesteria's movements are reconstituted through inheritance. Phantoms are not 'a machine for making the future'  (p. 33), but enable responsibility towards 'a "past" that has never been present, and which never will be, whose future to come will never be a production or a reproduction in the form of presence' (Derrida, 1982: 21, emphasis in original). 'As such' a phantom is im/possible, and therefore necessitates the making of determinations here and now.     Responsibility cannot be reduced to the adherence of preconceived norms of'good practice', or follow a demand for science 'to be "cutting edge'" (Fortun & Fortun, 2005:47). On the contrary, responsibility to the past and the future entails an opening-up of possibilities for different kinds of responses responses that may transform the 'edge' in the making of scientific cuts. In my account, responsibility happens within an entanglement of two indetermina cies between 'object' and 'agencies of observation' and between 'past' and  'future'. At stake is not only a particular content but the very meaning of'past' and 'future' in scientific practice. The 'past' can no longer be associated with what is already given or known; it rather is a matter of inheritance to which not only humans contribute. The scientific future is not a receding horizon to be populated with an ever increasing amount of human knowledges and tech nologies, but remains to come. Granting microorganisms a role in agency does not absolve humans from the responsibility to 'perpetually contest and rework [established] boundaries' (Barad, 2007: 205). Agency manifests itself after all as 'an enactment of ... changes to particular practices' (p. 178). Responsibility thus requires the interruption of 'the ordinary course of things, time and history here-now' (Derrida, 2002: 249).

Among the several thousand described species of dinoflagellates, about 80 are      considered to be toxic. This number is constantly increasing (Burkholder, 1998). Many      ecologists hold that formerly benign species have become toxic because of altered      environments.  2. 'Dino' - short for dinoflagellate, not to be confused with the 'fierce ones', as in      dinosaurs - is a Greek verb meaning 'spinning' or 'whirling' and refers to the movement      of these micro-critters, which propel themselves through the water with two flagella.  3. Coinciding with fish kill reports were reports by fisherman of skin lesions, disorientation      and memory loss (Burkholder, 1998).  4. A division of ontological questions and epistemological approaches to the study of      scientific objects has been a matter of recurring debate in Science Studies. According to      Sheila Jasanoff (2004), co-productionist approaches in Science Studies have either      focused on ontological questions concerning the emergence and stabilization of      scientific objects (which she terms 'constitutive co-production') or on conflicting      epistemologies within already demarcated domains. Hie latter, which Jasanoff calls an       'interactional approach' to co-production, is less concerned with 'what is and more with      how we know about it' (Hacking, 1999:169, quoted in Jasanoff, 2004: 19).  5. Steve Hinchliffe (2001) makes a similar distinction between uncertainty and      indeterminacy.  6. Herzig (2004) argues that when the constitutive contradictions entailed in deconstructive      notions of performativity are erased, the studies of scientific performances become linked      to notions of production, highlighting 'some extreme forms of capitalist efficiency'       (Parker & Sedgwick, quoted in Herzig, 2004: 136). In lieu of human agency, power and      capital have become self-moving agents. 'The thing is defined by its movement' (Herzig,      2004: 137). Herzig calls for a renewed attention to the constitutive contradictions      entailed in deconstructive notions of performativity. In part, this essay follows Herzig's      call. See also Maurer (2000) for an intervention into unexamined 'nature of movement'      inherent in narratives of scientific and capitalist progress.  7. This is consistent with Latour's belief in an 'arrow of time' pointing from simplicity      towards increasing complexity as network connections expand and all actors gain      in activity.  8. As Vicky Kirby (1997: 123) asserts, a real-ization of matter as 'effect[s] reverses      the logic of causality but does not contest its linear discriminations of difference     as separability'.  9. While 'epistemic things embody what one does yet not know' (Rheinberger, 1997: 28),     they are not '"merely" epistemic', as Joe Rouse (2002: 338) puts it. They do not follow     trajectories towards predefined objects; they rather must be capable of transformations     leading to 'unprecedented events.' As scientific objects, they are 'absent in their      experimental presence' (Rheinberger, 1997: 28, 134). 10. The fact that 'there can be no single, identically conceived and experienced "real" time'      (Weston & Helmreich, 2006) cannot be reduced to an acknowledgement of the     multiplicity of times. Rather, any attempt to grasp 'real time' as bounded interval, a      spatialized moment, or full presence, can, paradoxically, conceive of the difference that      differentiates between 'past' and 'future' moments in time only as absence. 11. In 1997, the Clinton administration established the 'Pfiesteria Research Act',      authorizing $12 million over the following 2 years for /y^ma-related research      (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Legislative Informer, 1997).

The authors of the 1998 Raleigh Report, a summary of a workshop to assess 'Pfiesteria    Research Needs and Management Actions', suggest:
    There can be little question that decreases in nutrient loading (both organic and      inorganic forms of nitrogen and phosphorus) will reduce eutrophication and,     thereby, lower the risk of toxic outbreaks of Pfiesteria-likz dinoflagellates, hypoxia,     and fishkills. However, sufficient scientific information does not exist at present to     quantitatively determine causal relationships, with confidence, between specific     sources and rates of nutrient inputs (that can be attributed to particular land-use     practices) and the occurrence of toxic events attributed to Pfiesteria piscicida or the     Pfiesteria-like organisms (Raleigh Report, 1998).
Discussing climate change science and policy, Shackley and Wynne (1996) make a     similar argument: On one hand 'the scientists' authority may reside precisely in their      informal judgments of uncertainty' and on the other hand, there is confidence that the     uncertainties will be reduced by further research (pp. 277, 283). 14. See Hayden (2003) for a discussion of a necessary separation of what 'life is' and from     what 'life does' for an association of bioactivity with the 'production of value' in plants. 15. The distinction I am making here between uncertainty and indeterminacy derives from     Barad's reading of Niels Bohr's interpretation of quantum physics. In his initial      (epistemological) formulation of the 'uncertainty principle' in quantum mechanics,     Heisenberg first assumed (and later corrected) that position and momentum of a     particle cannot be known at the same time, because the measurement process would     distort an underlying reality in such a way that complementary properties would not be     accessible to a human observer at the same time. According to Bohr, on the contrary,      'particles don't have determinate values of position and momentum simultaneously'      (Barad, 2007: 19). Since the measurement of position and momentum of an object     entail mutually exclusive experimental apparatuses, determinate values do not exist at      the same time. In Bohr's own words, 'in this context, we are of course not concerned     with a restriction as to the accuracy of measurement, but with the limitation of the well     defined space-time concepts' (Bohr quoted in Plotnitsky, 2003 [1995]: 24). 16. Such agency is distinct from various other versions of'material agency' wiggling      through the Science Studies literature. Material agency cannot be attributed to 'objects      that do things in the world', nor can it be reduced to random unpredictable changes of      'natural forces' or machinic extensions of human productivities (Pickering, 1995: 6-7, 9).    Material agency is not situated somewhere external to or outside of a human realm, but     displaces the very distinction between human and nonhuman agency. The problem of      symmetry between human and nonhuman agencies, which preoccupied much of the     actor network theory (ANT), is not an issue here (Callon, 1986), since neither the dinos     nor their investigators are preformed entities before they intra-act. Pfiesteria are neither     actors, nor quasi-objects, which would follow a continuous trajectory of increasing      stabilization from existence to essence. The dinos are explicitly not temporally emergent     - as long as emergence is figured as happening progressively in an externalized flux of      time. When grammar fails and I nevertheless speak of Pfiesteria's agency, it should be     kept in mind that the dinos are neither pre-existing subjects nor objects. The same holds     for the experimenting humans. 17. A phenomenon is 'an ontological inseparability of agentially intra-acting components'     (Barad, 2007:33). 18. Peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probes are synthetic molecules that contain the same     nucleotide bases as DNA, but replace the negatively charged backbone with a neutrally      charged peptide backbone. The neutral charge allows them to penetrate the cell more      easily than conventional DNA probes (Litaker et al., 2002a). 19. In Burkholder's early experiments, amoeboid morphs played a vital role as participants     in Pfiesteria's toxicity. While Burkholder et al. (2001a) still insist that amoebae are part    of Pfiesteria's life cycle when exhibiting toxicity, they are no longer judged to play an    important role in fish attacks.

According to Nancy Krieger (1997), in epidemiology, the notion of a single causative     agent was replaced during the mid-20th century by a 'web of causation' taking multiple     environmental and social factors into account. Recently however, the view that 'each     disease is caused by one agent' has regained prominence since, as one epidemiologist     argues, 'the future of epidemiology lies in the search for genetic markers'. 21. The Koch Postulates appear in various versions in the literature. The version presented     here follows Glasgow et al. (2001) and the one used by the VIMS researchers (available      at <www.vims.edu/env/projects//^'^5rena/Aphano.html>, accessed 29 December 2009). 22. Parrow et al. (2005) have also conducted 'contaminant free' experiments studying    Pfiesteria's intra-action with fish tissue. Pfiesteria was observed to feed on fish cells,     exhibiting heightened reproductive activities. From such experiments, however, few     conclusions can be drawn about Pfiesteria's involvement in fish kills. What would 'killing'     mean when the fish are already taken apart? 23. Pfiesteria-like organisms (PLOs) refer to zoospores of dinoflagellates that look similar to     Pfiesteria piscicida zoospores (as previously defined by scanning electron microscopy)      under a light microscope (Pfiesteria Interagency Coordination Workgroup, 2000). 24. Derrida insists that 'one can never distinguish between the future-to-come (Ta-venir)      and the coming back (revenant) of a specter' (1994: 38). 25. Ian Hacking (1995: 94) makes a similar argument, restricting it, however, to human     memories: 'a new past comes into being once events are recalled and described within a      structure of causation and explanation'. 26. The determination of a range of environmental conditions under which Pfiesteria     maintain their toxicity does not demonstrates a link between the proliferation of toxic     Pfiesteria and nutrition pollution. However, the knowledge of these conditions is      necessary in order to establish such a link in separate experiments. 27. Matters of concern are not to be confused with intentions of particular scientists nor      are they solely human affairs. Here, matters of concern are also not relations or      associations that replace matters of fact, as Latour (2004) proposes; they neither      precede nor follow matters of fact, but rather condition them. 28. Not only does Pfiesteria's phantomatic ontology call into question any securely bounded      atemporal existence of these toxic dinoflagellates, but also unsettles the notion of an      unbridgeable ontological difference between the 'human' and its 'animal other' on     which conventional articulations of responsibility to the 'other' would rely.
