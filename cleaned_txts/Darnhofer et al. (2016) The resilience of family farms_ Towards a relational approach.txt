Article history:                                          Family farms play an important role in the European countryside, yet their number is steadily declining. Received 7 July 2015                                      This raises the question of what conveys resilience to family farms, i.e. the ability to persist over the longReceived in revised form                                  term through buffering shocks and adapting to change. Within the current approaches to farm resilience, 11 January 2016                                                           we distinguish between two perspectives: the ﬁrst focuses on material structures and highlights the role Accepted 21 January 2016 Available online xxx                                                           of farm types and ecological dynamics. The second focuses on actors and highlights that farmer agency                                                           and wider social forces also play important roles.

A second group of approaches focuses on the inﬂuence of social dynamics and emphasize agency. Studies in this perspective focus on farmers' perceptions and how their choices inﬂuence the adaptation of their farms, but also on the role played by larger social forces. To overcome both the ecological-social and the structureagency dichotomies, we propose a third perspective on farm resilience, one focusing on relations. Resilience is then understood not as a ﬁxed asset but as emerging from the dynamics of enacted relations, relations that are continuously remade in interaction with the past and with the current context.
Resilience thinking
   Resilience is a term that is increasingly popular, both in policy contexts and in scientiﬁc debates (Davidson, 2010; Walker and Cooper, 2011). Resilience thinking not only emphasizes that change is ubiquitous, it also highlights that the source, type, timing, duration and impact of change is often unpredictable. As such it                                                                                           Fig. 1. For a farm to be resilient, it needs to be able to navigate the adaptive cycle. This emphasizes that to persist over the long term, a system needs to                                                                                           includes long periods of marginal change where connections between resources are                                                                                           ﬁne-tuned to increase efﬁciency. However, over time the system becomes rigid.

Indeed, while at                  and the search for objective measures to assess its resilience.

The literature on food sovereignty and                          rable from the spatial and temporal contexts within which they are agroecology amply demonstrates how much the question of what                               embedded, i.e. both their farm and the wider social and ecological food to grow, and how to grow it is contested (Alonso-Fradejas                             context; but also the temporal context, i.e. building on and reviset al., 2015; Levidow, 2015).

Building on                          the same time highlighting that the experiments contribute to Elias (1978), farming resilience can be seen as akin to playing a                             these shifts. For example, a farmer from the Austrian study told of game of cards (Fig. 4). To focus on the relations, it is important not                        experimenting with wrapping square bales of grass in plastic, as an to see the ‘game’ as a static thing that is then ‘played’, to avoid                           alternate way to produce silage. However, the experiment went reifying ‘the game’ as if it were separate from the players. It is not                        awry: mice bit through the wrapping, the grass fermented and was about assessing the skill of the player in isolation, or the impact of                        unusable as feed. As the farmer discussed the mishap with an the hand of cards she has been dealt. Indeed, neither guarantees                              organic farmer, the latter suggested composting.

Indeed, how farming re-enacts relations is                          The relational perspective allows focusing on adaptability and contingent on those relations that are enabled by current bio-                    transformability by highlighting that farming is always in the physical conditions.

Farming is always being made, always unﬁnished ceptualization of societyenature interactions, thus revealing new interconnections between the social and the biophysical domains.     A relational approach allows to highlight how farming modiﬁes and is modiﬁed by relations between a range of natural and social processes. For example in the Austrian study, the alpine pastures that are highly valued by ecologists for their unique biodiversity, are not ‘natural’: without cows grazing them in summer, many would revert to forest. Historically, this practice was developed due to a scarcity of feed: ﬂatter areas in the valleys were used for cropping, so that other feed resources had to be developed and maintained. Nowadays feed can be imported from around the globe, leading to the abandonment of this labour-intensive practice. However, for many farmers, maintaining traditional practices is identity-forming, and new relations have been built between the alpine pastures, the cows, their milk, the bacteria (used to make cheese), the farmers, consumers, and (often) tourists. This example shows how farming is constituted through diverse relations between human actors and a broad range of ecological aspects of farming, and how these relations are ﬂuid, always changing, interacting with other social and biophysical processes. The resilience of farming in alpine areas emerges from the ability to adapt                Fig. 5. Relational approach emphasizes that there are always excess possibilities, as and transform relations between ecological and social processes.                  exempliﬁed by different ‘styles of farming’ or the coexistence of organic and convenThese relations are not deﬁned by stable ﬂows of nutrients, of in-                tional farms in a region. A relational approach also highlights that farming is an onformation, or meaning, but constantly redeﬁned in response to a                   going process of ‘becoming’: not only do relations change within a speciﬁc path,                                                                                   there is also path creation through bifurcation.
