Knowledge that affects: an assemblage approach Tilman Hertz 1       and Francois Bousquet 2
ABSTRACT. There is consensus in the field of sustainability science that co-production of knowledge is needed to generate knowledge that is useful for addressing matters of concern. The field has made important advances, particularly focusing on developing strategies and principles that ensure the effective co-production of knowledge. Although these lay necessary foundations, less attention has been paid to the question as to what exactly is meant to “happen” in such processes. What is meant to happen, we argue, is that such processes generate knowledge that affects, by which we mean that it triggers an experiential intensity. Although affect ultimately underlies all kinds of knowledge (e.g., representational, such as discourse, or embodied, such as habits), different kinds and contents of knowledge affect (or not) participants of co-production processes in different ways. This paper thus argues that paying attention to affect in knowledge co-production increases the likelihood that it will be acted upon. To illustrate this point, we conceptualize knowledge as an assemblage generated through processes of knowledge co-production. We argue that for knowledge to affect, it must align the different kinds of knowledge mobilized in the process with the concrete experiences of those meant to act on it. In this paper, we particularly focus on the representational, discursive kind of knowledge, often of scientific nature, which continues to dominate processes of knowledge co-production, and explore alignment dynamics with the affective. In particular, we argue that applying methods and techniques that give room to the multimodal and multisensory nature of affect in co-production processes can support such alignment. We argue that the picture of knowledge co-production that emerges from our work as a potentially open-ended process of assembling is adequate for engaging with complex sustainability concerns in a world in constant becoming.

In addition to this (nonClark et al. 2016, Norström et al. 2020, Orlove et al. 2023) and exhaustive) list, scholars have also explored how language used                                                                             articulated corresponding policy instruments (e.g., Orlove et al. and framing of environmental problems play a crucial role in                                                                             2023).

That the resulting knowledge is           relational and situated (Ingram 2013, Klein et al. 2024), that is, experienced as abstract is often said to be characteristic of a             as situated and becoming meaningful through the relations that traditional model of knowledge production according to which                knowledge holders have with one another and their surroundings.

Put differently, relational knowledge is not only about content but        as IPBES (Díaz et al. 2015). Indeed, not only is knowledge diverse also about how this content “originates as a result of relational          in terms of its content but it also comes in multiple kinds. There processes that are shaped by procedural, emotional, structural, and        is, of course, representational knowledge, by which we mean context-dependent characteristics” (Brugnach and Ingram                    knowledge that is expressed via language, symbols, or images and 2017:35). Accordingly, the process of knowledge production is also         among which we situate the scientific one, that is, the discursive situation-specific, resulting from complex and synergetic social           and representations-based knowledge of environmental interactions (Brugnach and Ingram 2012, Brugnach 2017).                    assessments discussed above. But there is also embodied                                                                            knowledge (Merleau-Ponty 2010, Shapiro 2019) that is situated However, despite these strategies and despite the recognition of                                                                            in the body as well as expressed via the body and is often tacit knowledge as relational, many processes of co-production continue                                                                            and pre-discursive. Both kinds can in principle be rendered with to be dominated by a representational kind of knowledge of                                                                            an assemblage approach: Words can affect just as images or technical/scientific nature (Turnhout et al. 2013, Goldman et al.                                                                            gestures can. But this does not necessarily mean that they always 2018, Turnhout et al. 2020) that is often based in Western worldviews                                                                            do.

For this paper, we take the specific case of activities, and situations (see, e.g., Seiferth et al. 2024).                                                                            representational knowledge of scientific nature that continues to In this paper we join this discussion and hypothesize that for             dominate processes of knowledge co-production (Turnhout et al. knowledge to be usable in the sense defined above by West et al.           2013, Goldman et al. 2018, Turnhout et al. 2020) and reflect on (2019), it needs to affect those who are meant to act on it, that is, it   an alignment between, on the one hand, knowledge that is coded needs to trigger an experiential intensity, very much in the way           via scientific representations and, on the other hand, the affective, Arnold Bennett puts it in the opening quote of this paper.                 that is, how those who are meant to act experience particular Accordingly, we argue that one of the reasons for the disconnect           knowledge in connection with their concrete life-worlds. between knowledge and action is that the affective dimension of            Alignment would thus mean that knowledge that is coded via knowledge is disregarded for the benefit of an overemphasis on a           certain representations also affects, that is, triggers an experiential form of knowledge that focuses solely on representationalist               intensity (the “force” from the opening quote of this paper). This content. This is in line with recent calls by scholars, such as            is because it can be invoked from “within” how those who are Nightingale et al., who call for “affective knowing”: “Rather than         meant to act experience their life-worlds. Finally, the third relying exclusively on ‛hard’ scientific data as means to ‛tame’           purpose of this paper is to reflect on what all of this could mean uncertainty and unknowability, we need affective knowing to                for those who are engaged in or facilitate processes of cotransform current inaction and promote effective [...] action” (our        production. For an assemblage approach to realize alignment emphasis; Nightingale et al. 2022:7). What we hypothesize is that          (within principles and policy mechanisms structuring knowledge while stipulating principles and corresponding policy instruments          production processes), Brugnach and Ingram (2017) have for co-production of knowledge is certainly necessary, we believe          highlighted that those involved (e.g., scientists) need to be that by being attentive to the affective their successful                  knowledge brokers and meaning managers instead of simply implementation can be enhanced.                                            being those who transfer knowledge.

Affects are not states, but variations collaborative process of knowledge production can enable the            that occur within events. Spinoza defines them as variations in kind of self-reflective stance required to ensure that processes of     one body, caused by another body, or as that by which the power knowledge production across different knowledge systems                 to act is increased or decreased (Spinoza 1985).

We conclude this manuscript         The “pre-personal” part of affects that Deleuze and Guattari with demonstrating the relevance of our approach by reporting           identify refers to the idea that affects ultimately underlie all on our empirical work from an ongoing research project around           coding, that is, all fixing of reality into determinate bodies via vulnerability and adaptation of a multifunctional landscape to          representations. Put differently, although affects may manifest via climate change in Southern France.                                      representations, they refer, fundamentally, to pure potential and                                                                         becoming, and some scholars have identified similarities with REPRESENTATION AND AFFECT                                               Bergson’s “elan vital” that refers to “the vital impetus or force A representation is a mental entity that refers to reality. In this     that propels life forward from its beginnings and through all its quality representations engage with reality via concepts that code      varieties and forms” (Robinson 2009:224). How do representation it. A representation is thus productive and refers to a particular      and affect relate? Whereas representations code reality, which way of referring to reality that makes it intelligible, which in turn   means that bodies become determinate via representations, affects means that through them bodies become determinate as bodies             refer to how the ability of bodies to affect and be affected varies (we use the term “body” here as the most general designation of         within concrete interactions. Therefore, how a particular body is “things,” be they material and/or ideational). Traditionally,           represented at any particular moment is the result of how the representations have been evaluated with respect to properties          body is experienced within encounters (Cabello 2024). For such as consistency, truth, or accuracy. More precisely, it is to       instance, the same place can be represented in radically different what is captured in the relation between representation and reality     ways, depending on how encounters by different actors have that properties like consistency or truth apply.                        shaped it (Ingold 1993, Schama 1996). Accordingly, The relation between representation and reality has traditionally       corresponding knowledge about it will reflect the unique ways in been seen either as corresponding to reality or as constructed, in      which problems are framed, priorities set, scales considered, etc. which case it is seen as cohering with a wider system of other,         (Brugnach 2017). The picture that emerges from the dynamic, connected representations. But both of these traditions share the       interactive, and co-constitutive relation between representation same representationalist assumptions in that both mediate our           and affect points to the relational character of knowledge access to the material world. Where they differ, philosopher Karen      highlighted above as well as to a potential co-existence of a Barad notes, “is on the question of referent, whether scientific        multitude of different, even mutually exclusive ways of knowing. knowledge represents things in the world as they really are (i.e.,      At the same time, knowledge is “open”: As indicated previously, nature) or objects that are the product of social activities (i.e.,     affects are becomings, which means that affects have the potential culture)” (Barad 2007:48), a point she attributes to philosopher        to go beyond what is captured by representations.

Thus,      operationalize the notion of “being alien” we bring together bits whether representational knowledge does or does not affect is             and pieces from different sources: First, from Gilles Deleuze and intimately tied to cognitive processes. Cognition is thus a               Félix Guattari we take assemblages that they introduce as part of precondition for the affect of representational knowledge to realize.     various works, but especially in their seminal work A Thousand The two major approaches to cognition are symbolic and                    Plateaus (Deleuze and Guattari 1987). Second, from Karen Barad, connectionist. For the former, representations pre-exist and are the      from whom we take the notions of intra-active material-discursive main concept that cognitive rules operate on, whereas for the latter,     practices enacting perspectives (or, in her words, “cuts”) according they are emergent from “a largely unconscious process in which            to which reality becomes intelligible (Barad 2007). We further make many pieces of information are combined in parallel into a coherent       a distinction between assemblages and perspectives, and argue that whole...the result of mentally balancing many complementary and           assemblages are perspective-dependent. Cognition, we argue conflicting pieces of information until they all fit together in a        below, is the property of a meaning-giving perspective, that is, a satisfying way” (Thagard 2000:3). According to this latter view,          product of a way of engaging with (and enacting) reality, identities and worldviews do not pre-exist but rather emerge from         engagement which is material as well as discursive. We then these relationships (Homer-Dixon et al. 2013). As O’Brien and             conceptualize knowledge as an assemblage and see affect as the Milkoreit note, “a simplified but useful way to conceptualize             product of an assemblage that is dependent on a particular cognition is to conceive of minds as complex systems or networks          perspective. This accounts for the radical diversity of (truthful) of interdependent concepts (‛mental representations’). In this model      knowledge, that is, for the diversity of knowledge assembled on of cognition as belief systems, meaning is not inherent in a particular   the basis of the same perspective (which might imply that concept but emerges from the relationships between them and the           knowledge is commensurable) as well as diversity of knowledge way information flows (i.e., ‛is processed’) within this specific         assembled on the basis of different perspectives (which might imply network structure” (O’Brien and Milkoreit 2022:133).                      incommensurability; see also Hertz et al. 2024). Although for these two approaches cognition “happens” in the              Assemblages brain, some scholars have moved away from the idea of the brain           Assemblages are introduced by philosophers Gilles Deleuze and alone processing information to one that reconnects brain and body,       Félix Guattari (1987). Assemblages are a response to dominant representation and action, cognition and the environment. Through         attempts to understand reality by reducing the complexity of our concepts of enaction, situatedness or distributed cognition,              (social-ecological) world via generalizations (Srnicek 2007, cognition emerges from the interactions between the brain, the body,      Holland 2013). Details matter, and they do so profoundly, and and the environment (Lakoff and Johnsen 1999, Semin and Smith             assemblages are ways and means to tackle complexity “head on” 2002). As Hutchins notes, “what evolves is not the brain alone, but       (Srnicek 2007). An assemblage is a collection of radically the system of brains, bodies, and shared environments for action in       heterogeneous bodies, or things (ideas, norms, concepts, interaction....Careful attention to the microstructure of interaction     instruments, people, etc.) that organize into emergent “doings.” from the distributed cognition perspective leads to a                     Ghoddousi and Page define an assemblage as “the comingreconceptualization of the individual-environment relationship and        together of human and non-human ‛things’ that take on an suggests that this newly conceived relation has important                 emergent agency. By agency, we mean the ability to do something, implications for the way we confront many sorts of cognitive and          to affect and be affected” (Ghoddousi and Page 2020:3). We anthropological problems” (Hutchins 2006:395). In brief, cognition        experience, learn, and gather knowledge about the world in very is considered not only to be located in the body of a human               different ways, and the assemblages responsible for this equally processing information or in the network of connections between           take different forms, a book being as much an assemblage as a entities but is produced by dynamic interactions between all of these.    demonstration, a piece of art, a disaster, or an ecosystem service. Such an approach sees cognition as distributed and emergent.              Put differently, knowledge (that affects) is not only assembled as                                                                           part of representational kinds of knowledge, such as textbooks or ASSEMBLAGE APPROACH GROUNDED IN                                           manuals, but can also manifest as embodied (Merleau-Ponty 2010, PERSPECTIVISM                                                             Shapiro 2019). Assemblages that are embodied affect in different Having introduced the notions of representation and affect, as well       ways and are assembled as part of different bodies than textbooks as how these are discussed within the scholarship about cognition,        or manuals are; see, e.g., Verlie’s (2019) “climatic-affective we come back to the core concern of this paper: understanding the         atmospheres” or Neimanis and Walker’s (2014) “weathering.” This process by which knowledge comes to affect. For this, we noted            wide variety of assemblages also points to the variety of ways in above that the focus should lie not only on the relation of               which assemblages can affect. representations with reality (the domain of truth) but also on the process by which such knowledge is acquired (the domain of                Assemblage theory adopts a pragmatist stance where what cognition). The previous section provided arguments for cognition         something “is” is defined by its place in the assemblage, that is, by being situated, and if we combine this insight with insights of a         its capacity to affect and be affected. In this sense what something more philosophical nature about truth being historically and              “does” defines what something “is.” Deleuze and Guattari note, socially situated and dynamic (Hacking 1999), we begin to see a           “we know nothing about a body until we know what it can do, in picture around affect and diversity of knowledge systems emerge.          other words, what its affects are, how they can or cannot enter into However, precisely because of knowledge being historical and              composition with other affects, with the affects of another body, socially situated, different bodies of knowledge can be radically         either to destroy that body or to be destroyed by it, either to different, even alien to each other and thus fail to affect when          exchange actions and passions with it or to join with it in exchanged over.                                                           composing a more powerful body” (Deleuze and Guattari                                                                           1987:257).

That the material and the one body simultaneously takes part in many assemblages (see Box           discursive are intra-active means, as Barad notes, that “the 1). Thus, for assemblage theory, a representation (a lake as part         relationship between the material and the discursive is one of of the spirit of place, the lake as a reservoir) neither corresponds      mutual entailment.

The term “human” has by bodies within assemblages defines the representational content         a material counterpart, that is, a body with which it intra-acts, of bodies.                                                                just as it intra-acts, for example, with everything that is nonhuman. The term “natural resource” might be an example of such                                                                           a non-human that also has a variety of materialities with which                                                                           it intra-acts.

The value of an assemblage approach can be exemplified by                 Perspectives can, in principle, perform reality in very different showing how it can be mobilized for rendering radically different         ways; see Box 2 below. At the same time perspectives can also be assemblages. For example, some landscapes are said to have a              shared, in as much as material-discursive practices are shared. In certain “spirit.” We take such a “spirit” to emerge from a                other words, one could conceive of a perspective as a “space,” that particular arrangement of heterogeneous elements such as ideas,           is, a shared but also always contested space of intelligibility.

That an assemblage is perspective-dependent means the landscape in question. But these elements are diverse and it          that its capacity to affect is also perspective-dependent. Although is easily imaginable how each of them could “do” different things         it is true that pure affects, that is, pure intensities, escape any when part of different assemblages.

For example, as part of Western      elements that are also part of other knowledge assemblages. practices of engaging with landscapes (e.g., agriculture, sports,      This does justice to the fact that knowledge is often enmeshed, residence, etc.) humans tend to become determinate as separate         that is, blending different kinds of knowledge, embodied, from and above nature (Böhme et al. 2021). This is very different      representational, etc., and stemming from different from how many practices around the world enact reality (West et        engagements with a particular issue. This also explains why al. 2024). For example, the Andean practice of “in-ayllu” discloses    knowledge can at times be incoherent or conflictual. communities and the mountains they live on as “Earth Beings” as inseparable (Cadena 2015). As another example, Apgar et al. report from the spiritual practice of the Guna peoples of Panama where all things and beings are disclosed as one system, a “wholesystem view [that] emphasizes a fundamental connectedness and relationship, and promotes continued reflection on identity and purpose in the world” (Apgar et al. 2015:45). In turn, assemblages are assembled in accordance to how reality is enacted by perspectives, that is, assemblages draw on elements that thus become determinate. Accordingly, it is not only the case that within different assemblages the representational content of a particular body differs, as that could still be accounted for according to a same perspective (see Box 1), but more radically, that bodies themselves might become determinate in different and perhaps incommensurable ways as part of different perspectives. Here, differences between assemblages cannot be rendered, discussed, and compared by reference to the same perspective.
The interplay between stability and change: how assemblages “become” The term assemblage not only refers to an existing formation. Indeed, whereas in English assemblage is most commonly used                                                                        Networks of power, as we interpret them here, refer to the power as a noun, the original French term agencement refers to both, a                                                                        that is inherent in representations and perspectives when noun as well as a verb (DeLanda 2016). As McHugh notes, it                                                                        conditioning events of experience. Such networks form, for “simultaneously denotes both an existing social formation and                                                                        example, around institutions for water management or the continual process of assembling and reassembling that                                                                        biodiversity conservation that condition the experience of bodies formation” (McHugh 2018:2). One can think of the process of                                                                        in different ways. assemblage formation as bodies continually meeting in events of experience that determine their capacity to affect and be affected:    However, we argue that while the capacity of bodies to affect and This capacity to affect and be affected simply is the                  be affected manifest within representations as coded, affects also representational content of bodies. Thus, for assemblage theory,       have the potential of going beyond this coding. In other words, representations emerge from how bodies affect each other within        the process of assembling harbors (ontological) openness/ an assemblage. The relation between affect and representation is       becoming. In what follows we explore the process of affects going thus a pragmatic one in that what something does defines what          beyond the coding of representation and perspectives. Indeed, something is and it is that which gets coded in a representation.      Thrift also notes that “the event does not end with these bare In turn, and more fundamentally, bodies themselves become              facts. The capacity to surprise may be latent, but it is always determinate as part of material-discursive practices that make up      present” (Thrift 2007:114). Put differently, “the event can be a perspective and that allow for different representations of a same   connected to potential, possibility, experimentation.” It is here body (see the example of a water body in Box 1).                       that affects come into play, notably when encounters between                                                                        bodies produce a “surplus” beyond the codings offered by Fundamentally, the experience of bodies and their capacities are                                                                        representations and ultimately perspectives, and which refers to conditioned and this conditioning is potent: With Thrift we note                                                                        a manifestation of ontological potential. By ontological potential that “events must take place within networks of power which have                                                                        we mean that novel capacities of bodies to act emerge, what Thrift been constructed precisely in order to ensure iterability [capacity                                                                        relates to the Deleuzian “virtual”: The generation of “doings” in to be repeatable across different contexts]” (Thrift 2007:114).                                                                        practice (Thrift 2007).

In case the representational content of a body is “fixed,” such as     terms of individual bodies is not applicable any more. In this sense, when a representation is seen as corresponding to reality (e.g., as    surplus changes the material-discursive practices that shape a part of a scientific practice that aims at providing a value-neutral   perspective. This perspective, in turn, conditions experience “mirror” of reality) or as cohering with a wider system of other       according to such a novel subjectivity that may conflict with a representations (e.g., as part of practices where the meaning of       modern political imaginary (Grove and Pugh 2018), which views representations needs to cohere with each other), “surplus” might      humans as separate from and above nature (Böhme 2022). find it hard to enter an event. This is because the networks of power that are inherent in these practices code the experience of a particular body via a representation.

Some might see the lake at the center of the original meaning and significance of what is exchanged over            landscape as a source for irrigation, whereas others might see the (Cadena 2015). Arts-based methods, on the other hand, strive “to       lake as a place for sport activities.

For others, difference arises because vulnerability is between those who are “walking together in a world of many             made sense of within different perspectives. For example, a worlds” (West et al. 2024:1; Cadena and Blaser 2018). In arts-         perspective that enacts the landscape as identity-giving and based encounters, affective surplus can be generated, leading to       relationally constituted conditions very different knowledge the representational content of what is exchanged over being           about vulnerability than a more distanced perspective, e.g., from adapted, re-interpreted, changed, or contextualized (Tsoukas           the prefecture of the department that enacts the landscape and 2018) so that corresponding affects can be brought to realize. For     lake as a critical water resource for drinking water, irrigation, and example, there is no one right or correct conceptualization of         firefighting. Here it is not only that the focus of vulnerability is vulnerability to climate change (Füssel 2007), instead                 different, but more fundamentally that the landscape itself vulnerability takes on very different meanings in different            becomes determinate in ways that are not necessarily comparable assemblages and perspectives. Arts-based encounters serve thus,        with each other, adding perhaps an additional layer of complexity on the one hand, as a means to communicate the “living                 to the process (see also Box 2). importance of things felt” (Whitehead 1968:15) of how                                                                        To engage with this diversity in view of generating knowledge that participants in the process experience vulnerability, and, on the                                                                        affects we applied methods and approaches that allowed us to get other hand, as a tool for co-producing a common understanding                                                                        as close as possible to Whitehead’s “living importance of things of vulnerability specific to a particular process of knowledge cofelt” (Whitehead 1968:15). For this, we focused on relational production.                                                                        interviewing (Hydén 2014, Fujii 2017, Mancilla Garcia et al. 2024) As part of the process of encounters across different perspectives,    that we enacted via a combination of walking interviews (Evans the material-discursive practices enacting them (the perspectives)     and Jones 2011) and playback theater (Fox 1982).

This kind of theater (playback DEMONSTRATION IN THE MAKING                                            theater; Fox 1982) is particularly well-suited because, first, it In this section we show how we have applied (or rather are in the      amplifies affect and gives it “back” to the agents, who feels that process of applying) the framework developed in the earlier            what they shared is valued; and second, because agents notice that sections of this paper.

Representation The field of knowledge co-               While traditional accounts of                production is wide and diverse so it     knowledge co-production are                is not clear to what extent a shared     uncommitted to a particular view on the                definition of representation exists.     relation between a representation and                Often a representation has an            reality, an assemblage approach takes a                explicitly social dimension (Jodelet     specific view on representations: They                1989) and is considered to be a          emerge within assemblages conditioned                form of knowledge, socially              by perspectives. An assemblage                elaborated and shared, contributing      approach takes an explicitly pragmatist                to the construction of a reality         approach whereby what something is                common to a social entity. While         (i.e. how it is represented) is defined by                the emphasis lies on construction -      what it does (defined by its                and thus coherence accounts of the       position/role in the assemblage).                relation between representations                and reality - the field also                acknowledges correspondence and                pragmatist accounts. Implicit                commitments to particular accounts                of the relation between                representation and reality have                consequences for co-creation                processes (see section on                “representation and affect”). Affect          The concept of affect as that which    Affects are not a property of the human                 changes “a body’s capacity to affect   subject but of that which produces                 and be affected” is rarely used. If    human subjects (and all other bodies) in                 anything the concept is discussed      the first place: representations,                 alongside other concepts such as       assemblages, perspectives. Affects lie at                 emotions that are mobilized for        the heart of the pragmatist                 building trust or enhancing            dynamics: On the one hand, affects is                 engagement or and/or decision          coded, for example, via representations,                 making of participants involved in     on the other hand, the notion of                 processes of co-production. Affect     affective surplus defies coding by                 thus mostly manifests via emotions     representations and allows changing                 and is restricted to / a property of   how a body is represented. What bodies                 human subjects. It is about how        are and do is thus not fully fixed by                 emotions change humans capacity        representations but can change in                 to affect and be affected in           affective encounters. This capacity for                 processes of knowledge co-             change, this openness, is key for                 production.                            whenever processes of alignment need                                                        to bridge different ways in which                                                        representations, assemblages,                                                        perspectives code experiences of                                                        participants of co-production processes.

Perspectives/   The notion of perspective is usually   An assemblage approach takes an Assemblage      seen as the point of view of           explicit stance regarding perspectives.                 participants in the knowledge co-      A perspective is not something a human                 production.

Rather, human subjects (just                 representations from a particular      like all bodies) are products of the                 perspective.

The notion of assemblages is largely absent in the literature on traditional coproduction.
