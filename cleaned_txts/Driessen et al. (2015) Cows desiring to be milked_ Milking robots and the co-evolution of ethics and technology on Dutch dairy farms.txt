Holloway (2007) has pointed to the paradoxical nature of the discourse emerging around AMS                A recurring theme in farmer’s discussions of cows is their about the system generating more freedom for the cows                  purported laziness.

(2014) this kind of talk of the simple releasing of an inherent subjectivity which was             laziness of cows is an example of farmers ascribing subsuppressed in conventional milking systems (Holloway                   jectivity to cows that will lead to either disciplining them, 2007, p. 1050). With this type of critique, however, in                e.g., by electrical prods, or culling.
