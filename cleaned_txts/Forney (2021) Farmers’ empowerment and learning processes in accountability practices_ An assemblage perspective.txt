The example of IP-Suisse, a Swiss farmer organisation and a food label, allows us to                                                              identify multiple contradictory power and knowledge processes that are simultaneously unfolding within the                                                              agri-environmental governance assemblage.

Introduction                                                                                            This anecdote is drawn from an ethnography of the assemblage of                                                                                                        actors within the farmers organisation IP-Suisse.

It created a standard and a food recent general assembly. The member, a beef farmer, had just expressed                                 label around the notion of ‘integrated production’ (IP), as a middle way his disappointment with the way he was treated by an industrial                                        between conventional and organic agriculture. The farmers organisation slaughterhouse when he delivered an animal to it. The slaughterhouse                                   went on to become a central actor in the Swiss agri-food system. The had refused to pay the higher price guaranteed by the label, saying the                                short anecdote above points to the power relations that developed in this meat was too fatty for the label’s standard. But a few days later, in a                                process, revealing several problematic aspects of how, within the cur­ nearby supermarket, the farmer recognized his animal’s meat (traceable                                 rent practices of agri-environmental governance (AEG), how some thanks to a unique animal-specific tracking number) being sold under                                   agents are held more accountable than others. It also highlights the the label after all. Not only that, but the meat was also advertised as                                importance of ways of knowing food and farming.

Finally, the Learning Perspective looks at effec­                  diverging forms of knowledge applied to agriculture and the environ­ tiveness and its enhancement, by asking how accountability stimulates                   ment.

Yet, Bennett (2010) neatly sources for a reconfiguration of power relations (Rossi et al., 2019), also          describes how the assemblage then combines these individual intentions thanks to learning processes oriented toward more sustainable food                   and plans into the production of a distributed or confederate agency.

From this perspective,     In a discussion with Claire Parnet, Deleuze defines an assemblage as             accountability practices influence AEG assemblages by opening possi­ “a multiplicity which is made up of many heterogeneous terms and                     bilities for new alliances and combination of – human and non-human – which establishes liaisons, relations between them across ages, sexes and            agencies. reigns – different natures.” He adds that what makes the unity of the                    Information and learning processes are important elements in this assemblage is “co-functioning: it is a symbiosis, a ‘sympathy’.

Beyond this first general definition, Callon (2017)            duced through accountability practices can be mobilised, as allies, in offers more comprehensive synthesis of what characterizes assemblages:               power struggles.

This paper focuses on AEG assemblages under­                  terms of not only what ‘is’ but what ‘could be’” (Lewis et al., stood as complex aggregates of heterogeneous elements – human and                    2016:14–15). non-human – that are organised around a collective purpose, which is to                  Let me sum up in four points what it means to apply an assemblage propose solutions for environmental issues related to agricultural                   approach to power and knowledge in accountability practices. First, the production.                                                                          assemblage approach requires locating specific schemes within a     A few attempts to use assemblage theory to better understand AEG                 broader AEG assemblage to understand how they interconnect with practices in agri-food systems exist in the literature (Loconto 2015;                other governance practices. Second, it calls for an integrated analysis of Rosin et al., 2017; Legun and Sautier 2018; Konefal et al., 2019).                   knowledge and power, as two essential aspects of accountability that Interestingly, Loconto (2015) and Legun and Sautier (2018) point to the              develop in the interplay between concrete relations (the machinic, the construction of governance assemblages through actors’ interactions                  content) and narratives (the enunciative, the expression). Third, the and strategies rather than by analysing the effects of isolated in­                  assemblage approach points to the multiplicity of outcomes emerging struments. Applied to accountability practices and TSR, this principle               from accountability practices.

Fourth and finally, returning to the emphasis on possible evo­ policies, strategies developed by economic actors, etc. Drawing on                   lutions and potentials, an assemblage approach leads to an analysis of Dépelteau’s (2015) relational sociology (and not explicitly on assem­               the consequences of these processes of change and opens a discussion of blage theory), Darnhofer et al.

Researching the assemblage: methods and approach and is thus not determined by them” (203). This paper also contributes to a relational approach to AEG, from an assemblage perspective,                         At the level of methods, applying an assemblage approach to AEG moving away from linear definitions of accountability based on the                   governance implies a focus on relations and connections as a guiding principal-agent dichotomy, as used for instance by Bovens (2007), and                thread in exploring the constitution of AEG practices.
