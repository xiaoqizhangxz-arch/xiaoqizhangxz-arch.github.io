Acting like an algorithm: digital farming platforms and the trajectories they (need not) lock-in Michael Carolan1
Abstract This paper contributes to our understanding of farm data value chains with assistance from 54 semi-structured interviews and field notes from participant observations. Methodologically, it includes individuals, such as farmers, who hold well-known positionalities within digital agriculture spaces—platforms that include precision farming techniques, farm equipment built on machine learning architecture and algorithms, and robotics—while also including less visible elements and practices. The actors interviewed and materialities and performances observed thus came from spaces and places inhabited by, for example, farmers, crop scientists, statisticians, programmers, and senior leadership in firms located in the U.S. and Canada. The stability of “the” artifacts followed for this project proved challenging, which led to me rethinking how to approach the subject conceptually. The paper is animated by a posthumanist commitment, drawing heavily from assemblage thinking and critical data scholarship coming out of Science and Technology Studies. The argument’s understanding of “chains” therefore lies on an alternative conceptual plane relative to most commodity chain scholarship. To speak of a data value chain is to foreground an orchestrating set of relations among humans, non-humans, products, spaces, places, and practices. The paper’s principle contribution involves interrogating lock-in tendencies at di!erent “points” along the digital farm platform assemblage while pushing for a varied understanding of governance depending on the roles of the actors and actants involved.

From left behind to leader: gender, agency, and food sovereignty in China Li Zhang1
Abstract Capitalist reforms usually drive outmigration of peasants to cities, while elders, children, and women responsible for their care are “left behind” in the countryside. The plight of these “left behind” populations is a major focus of recent agrarian studies in China. However, rural women are not merely passive victims of these transformations. Building on ethnographic research in Guangxi and Henan provinces from 2013 to 2017, and drawing on critical gender studies and feminist political ecology, I show how the food safety crisis in China creates conditions for peasant women to increase control and income from organic food production, often establishing alternative food networks with the support of female scholars and NGO organizers. Thus, I shift focus of scholarship on rural women from “left behind” to leaders in struggles for justice and food sovereignty.

In the fifth section, I briefly discuss the ongoing challenges                    (Jacka 2013; Schneider 2015).

Virtualizing the ‘good life’: reworking narratives of agrarianism and the rural idyll in a computer game Lee-Ann Sutherland1
Abstract Farming computer games enable the ‘desk chair countryside’—millions of people actively engaged in performing farming and rural activities on-line—to co-produce their desired representations of rural life, in line with the parameters set by game creators. In this paper, I critique the narratives and images of farming life expressed in the popular computer game ‘Stardew Valley’. Stardew is based on a scenario whereby players leave a [meaningless] urban desk job to revitalize the family farm. Player are given a choice to invest in the Community Center or to support ‘JojaMart’, a ‘big-box’ development. The farming narrative demonstrates the hallmarks of classical American agrarianism: farming as the basic profession on which other occupations depend, the virtue of hard work, the ‘natural’ and moral nature of agricultural life, and the economic independence of the farmer. More recent discourses of critical agrarianism are noticeably absent, particularly in relation to environmental protection. Conflict is centred on urban-based big business, whereas the farm is represented as a ‘bolt-hole’ or sanctuary from urban life. I argue that embedding issues of big-box development in gameplay enrols players in active reflection and debate on desirable responses, whereas the emphasis on reproducing classical agrarian tropes risks desensitizing game players to contemporary agrarian social and environmental justice issues. However, Stardew Valley gameplay implicitly reinforces the ideal that low input farming is the way that agriculture should be practiced. The success of the game in eliciting on-line debates, and the requirement for active performance and decision-making, demonstrates the specific potential of computer games as mediums for influencing and intervening in ongoing reworking of farming imaginaries, and enabling more critically engagement of the ‘desk chair countryside’ in important global debates.

I recorded all subsequent                            of the medium in which it is developed. As a medium, gameplay, and selectively transcribed scenes the first time                         computer games are evolving and di#cult to categorize. they appeared in gameplay: much of gameplay is rote                                 Written text and language have limitations of expression repetition with few words (e.g. watering plants, feeding                            (e.g. Gkartzios and Remoundou 2018); computer games are livestock) where transcription is unnecessary.

This challenge may be artificially the ‘Community Center’ and ‘support Joja’ storylines until                          exaggerated by game designers to motivate gameplay, as all of the associated tasks were completed, in order to elicit                      Barone has done in his portrayal of JojaMart. In-game the primary game discourses. Data is thus comprised of                              interactions also have limits. In Stardew, statements made videos of gameplay, which were transcribed and logged with                          by in-game characters are necessarily short, confined to text screen shots for reference. I reviewed 3 YouTube videos and                         boxes. Player responses to dialogues are multiple choice, 14 on-line articles of interviews with Eric Barone, reaching                        limiting their range. While some text appears to comprise saturation in his available statements on game dynamics                             stories to entertain or attract the curiosity of the player, other and his personal intentions for the game.
