Keywords:                                                  Digitalisation is widely regarded as having the potential to provide productivity and sustainability gains for the Agricultural innovation systems                            agricultural sector. However, there are likely to be broader implications arising from the digitalisation of Agricultural advisory services                             agricultural innovation systems. Agricultural knowledge and advice networks are important components of Connectivity                                               agricultural innovation systems that have the potential to be digitally disrupted. In this paper, we review trends Transparency                                                            within agricultural knowledge and advice networks both internationally and in Australia, to anticipate and Governance                                                            prepare for potential transformations in these networks.                                                                Through a combined structured and traditional review of relevant literature, we come to three key conclusions regarding the state-of-the-art. First, the connectivity of humans and technologies in agricultural knowledge                                                            and advice networks and value chains will likely continue to increase. Second, transparency of agricultural                                                            practices and informational interaction between farmers, advisors, agri-businesses, consumers and regulators                                                            will drive and be driven by growing connectivity. Finally, there are likely to be challenges balancing the priorities of various agricultural stakeholders as agricultural innovation systems digitalise. These ﬁndings have                                                            implications for the oversight of international agri-food sectors.
