                                          Abstract: Resilience is a concept that focuses on change: it includes the ability of a system to maintain                                           its current state despite disturbances, its ability to adapt, and to transform. While resilience covers                                           both stability and change, conceptual developments and empirical studies have put more emphasis                                           on identifying what enables a farm to cope with the impact of a shock, such as a shift in markets                                           or an extreme weather event, while remaining essentially unchanged. Much less emphasis has                                           been put on what enables a farm to shape change, especially transformative change. I argue that                                           this bias is partly due to the ecological roots of the concept, and partly to the use of conventional                                           methods and their underlying substantialist worldview. A process-relational approach might be                                           better suited to capture change. This approach shifts the conceptualization of a ‘farm’ as a stable                                           material structure, to ‘farming’ as an open process of becoming, composed of heterogenous relations                                           that are continuously made and remade. By exploring the differences between these two approaches                                           to farm/farming resilience, I show how a process-relational approach displaces the presumption of                                           structural determination and thus allows to highlight the ever-present openings for change.

Introduction su13063387                                       In times marked by rapid and often unpredictable change, there is an increasing policy                                            attention to resilience. The European Commission has made it a cornerstone of its ‘Farm to Academic Editor: Giuseppe Todde            Fork Strategy’, declaring that “The EU’s goals are to reduce the environmental and climate                                            footprint of the EU food system and strengthen its resilience” [1] (p. 7), the OECD [2] Received: 12 February 2021                 released a report on ‘Strengthening agricultural resilience in the face of multiple risks’, and Accepted: 15 March 2021                    the FAO is preparing its flagship State Of Agriculture and Food 2021 report on ‘Building Published: 18 March 2021                   resilient food systems’. Research is thus called upon to identify ways to strengthen the                                            resilience of farms and agro-food systems, which raises two core issues: what is resilience Publisher’s Note: MDPI stays neutral       and how can it be assessed? with regard to jurisdictional claims in                                                  Resilience has been defined in a number of ways, but the most widely used definition published maps and institutional affilmay well be the one by the Resilience Alliance: “resilience is the capacity of a system to iations.                                            absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to still retain essentially                                            the same function, structure, and feedbacks, and therefore identity, that is, the capacity to                                            change in order to sustain identity” [3] (p. 4). This definition includes a somewhat uneasy                                            juxtaposition between absorbing disturbance and maintaining structure and feedbacks, i.e., Copyright: © 2021 by the author.          ‘bouncing back’; and the capacity to change, i.e., to ‘bounce forward’ [4,5].

                                 should be maintained, thus in effect serving to prop up the dominant system, which                                  may entrench current inequities [7–10]. Given the well-documented negative social and                                  environmental impact of the dominant intensive, modernized agro-food system [11–14],                                  transformative change may have a more important role to play in the social realm than in                                  the ecological realm.                                        As DeVerteuil and Golubchikov [10] argue, while these critiques of the use of the                                  resilience concept need to be taken seriously, they should not prevent a further engagement                                 with it, reconstructing it along critical lines. In the context of farming, shifting the emphasis                                  from the ability to cope with an external shock towards the ability to transform would                                  open new ways to conceptualize resilience. Resilience would no longer focus on ‘inertial                                 persistence’, but would focus on enabling proactive changes, where everyday relations are                                  negotiated and creatively reconstructed [10].                                        This shift would question ‘too easy’ conceptions of resilience at the farm level, especially those that explicitly or implicitly take a structural approach and focus on maintaining                                  the status quo, on attributes or characteristics of farms that indicate the ability to buffer                                  shocks and implement incremental changes so as to remain on the current trajectory. While                                  this is an important aspect of resilience, it is unlikely that it will suffice to enable a farm                                  to persist over the long-term. Farms also need to engage in transformative change, not                                  only as a response to external drivers, but also as a creative process, to realize projects that                                  emerge from within the farming family.                                        The aim of the paper is thus to explore whether a process-relational approach to                                  farming resilience can be helpful in capturing change, conceptualizing the ever-changing                                 processes in which farmers live and manage their farm. A process-relational approach                                  focuses on the relations between heterogenous elements, the relations that are constantly                                  made and remade, that could always be made differently, not least through different beliefs,                                 values, perceptions, and expectations. The question for research is then how it can highlight                                  these always-already-there openings for change, and how it can contribute to a context that                                  strengthens the ability of farmers to make use of them.                                        I start the paper by briefly reviewing the uneasy juxtaposition within resilience thinking, between maintaining and transforming a system. I then explore the process-relational                                  approach to farming resilience, which conceptualizes farming as an ongoing flow of transformations, an unfolding of propensities. I use an interview to illustrate the differences                                  between a conventional to farm resilience and a process-relational approach to farming                                  resilience, and I argue that, depending on the worldview taken, researchers might highlight                                  fixities or openings for change. A process-relational approach to farming resilience can thus                                  contribute to a different understanding of what enables farming to persist, not so much by                                 ‘discovering’ things before the unknown, but by reconceptualizing what is already known.
Conceptualizing Resilience                                 2.1. Maintaining a System as Including Transformative Change?                                      In the context of agriculture, the OECD defined resilience as “the ability to prepare                                 and plan for, absorb, recover from, and more successfully adapt and transform in response                                 to adverse events” [2] (p. 14). Just as the definition by the Resilience Alliance [3], as well                                 as those proposed by other major institutions such as the European Commission’s Joint                                 Research Centre [15], the IPCC [16], and the FAO [17], the definition covers the ability of a                                 system to absorb disturbances, to adapt, and to transform. While the definitions of resilience                                 cover all three aspects, it is not always clear how they are related conceptually [18–23].                                 Moreover, in the empirical use, there is a tendency for resilience to be understood as                                 maintaining a system. There is thus a somewhat ambivalent relationship with change,                                 especially transformative change, which—by definition—leads to a “fundamentally new                                 system” [3] (p. 4).                                      Indeed, it is not even quite clear whether ‘adaptive capacity’ is one aspect of resilience,                                 or whether ‘resilience’ and ‘adaptability’ are two distinct concepts that stand side-by-side.                                 A number of publications seem to imply that they are distinct by explicitly referring to Sustainability 2021, 13, 3387                                                                                            3 of 21
                                resilience and adaptive capacity, as is done by, e.g., the FAO [17] (p. vi) or the IPCC [24].                                 Despite the implied distinction, usually both terms refer to maintaining the status quo of                                 the system, which is understood as a dynamic equilibrium: a system should be able to                                 cope with the impact of shocks, and adapt by adjusting responses to changing external                                 drivers and internal processes, but only as long as the system remains within the current                                 stability domain (see [3]).                                       The emphasis on understanding resilience as maintaining the system in its current                                 stability domain is partly tied to the disciplinary context in which it has been used. For                                 example, in disaster studies, the short-term aim is usually to enable a city or a community                                 to ‘bounce back’ to the state before it was affected by, e.g., an extreme weather event                                 (see [25]). Similarly, in ecology, the desire is to flexibly guide the management of natural                                 resources so as to maintain the ecosystem within a basin of attraction or stability domain [3].                                 While some adaptive dynamics are allowed for, the ecosystem should not cross a threshold,                                 should not engage in a regime shift, or go past a ‘tipping point’ that would lead it to a                                 degraded, impoverished, undesirable state [26,27].                                       This dominant way to use resilience, emphasizing the ability to maintain the current                                 state, has several implications in the context of farms. Firstly, it frames change in negative                                 terms: change is understood as induced by ‘shocks’, ‘stresses’, ‘disturbances’, or ‘adverse                                 events’; it implies that stability is preferred and change—beyond a certain point—is often                                 undesirable. Secondly, the emphasis on external drivers of change has downplayed internal                                 drivers, implying that the system is in a dynamic equilibrium unless it is ‘disturbed’ by                                 external events. Thirdly, transformative change, i.e., engaging in novel developmental                                 pathways, is often side-lined, as new ways of thinking and operating, leading to unknown                                 development trajectories, are not the focus of attention. Indeed, the implicit aim is usually                                 to enable the current system to function as well as possible, not to transform it. This                                 framing has thus impaired the study of shocks as opportunities for change, of internal                                 drivers as essential in understanding the trajectory of a system, and a focus on transformational change as enabling a system that is more desirable than the current one. Indeed,                                 while farmers want to maintain the function of their farm (i.e., ensuring the livelihood of                                 the family, producing food and fiber, and maintaining the productivity of the land they                                 manage), they might well want to do so by changing the structure, identity, and feedbacks                                 of their farming system, e.g., by shifting from intensive production systems to low external                                 input systems [28–30].                                       The question is why the concept of resilience has been applied in a rather one-sided                                 way; why it has been tamed, despite being rooted in complexity thinking (see [31]). Why,                                 despite the fact that in his seminal paper Holling [32] emphasized the need to ‘expect                                 the unexpected’ and thus that “a management approach based on resilience ( . . . ) would                                 emphasize the need to keep options open” (p. 21), current approaches seem to reduce it to                                 another variant of risk management (see [2]). Why, despite acknowledging that “resilience                                 is complex, context-specific and highly dynamic—all characteristics that make it hard                                 to operationalize and measure through simple proxies” [33] (p. 6), much effort is being                                 invested to develop standardized tools, to assess resilience using compound indicators,                                 although these seem poorly apt at capturing the ability to take advantage of unpredictable                                 dynamics, or the ability to engage in transformative change.
                                2.2. Conventional Approaches to Farm Resilience: Substantialism and Stable Entities                                      The answer may be found partly in its disciplinary origin, and partly in the dominant approach to conceptualize resilience, which is rooted in a substantialist, mechanistic                                 worldview, which conceives the world as in equilibrium, even if a somewhat dynamic                                 one. Indeed, farms are often treated as if they were static and independent objects, an                                 approach that builds on substance ontologies that have influenced most of contemporary                                 science (see [34–38]). Modern sciences build on René Descartes, who posited that the                                 world is composed of physical and mental ‘substances’ that exist independently, and that                                 have an unchanging essence [34]. Descartes also used a machine as a metaphor for the Sustainability 2021, 13, 3387                                                                                             4 of 21
                                human body, thereby establishing a mechanistic framework that sees the world as orderly.                                 Newton, building on Descartes, conceived of all bodies as fundamentally inactive unless                                 some external force is applied to them [35]. Ever since the 18th century Enlightenment,                                 these notions have shaped how scientists view the world, i.e., mostly as filled with inert                                 substances that may interact, but that in their essence do not change; a world that is ordered                                 and thus predictable [34,35,39].                                       Transferring this worldview to farming systems also envisions them as solid, as                                 durable social and material structures, with an immutable essence, whose attributes can be                                 measured. Thus, when applying resilience thinking on farms, the aim is to identify those                                 criteria, indicators, or attributes that are associated with the ability to cope with disturbances, and to adapt while maintaining their identity. Several conceptual frameworks have                                 been advanced. While they all conceptualize farms as a social-ecological system, some tend                                 to emphasize the ecological (e.g., [30,40,41]) and others the social side (e.g., [42–44]). While                                 most frameworks strive to assess general resilience, some focus on specific disturbances,                                 such as the ability to cope with the impacts of climate change (e.g., [45,46]) or shocks such                                 as the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic [47].                                       Even with these conceptual frameworks, resilience is notoriously difficult to apply                                 empirically in a robust and meaningful manner (see [48–51]). Indeed, due to the irreducible                                 complexity of farming systems, the assessment of resilience will always be partial and                                 incomplete [40,52]. Yet, numerous studies have grappled with the challenge, and empirically applied resilience to understand how family farms persist in their farming activities,                                 despite numerous disturbances. Broadly speaking, these studies can be grouped in three                                 ontological approaches: positivist, interpretivist, and critical (see [53,54]).                                       For studies taking a positivist approach, the aim is objective knowledge, the search                                 for universal causal mechanisms that explain observed associations, e.g., between farm                                 persistence and farm structure, the mix of activities, or the allocation of resources, such as                                 land, labor, and capital. The focus is thus on observable facts, captured through measurement, statistics, surveys. Some studies have focused on the resilience of agroecosystems                                 (e.g., [55,56]); others have focused on farm management, using large data sets, e.g., from the                                 Farm Accountancy Data Network (e.g., [57]) or from surveys (e.g., [58,59]); yet others have                                 integrated the analysis of quantitative data and participatory assessments (e.g., [60,61]).                                 Such studies have explored the relationships between the structural features of farms                                 (e.g., type and size) and variables reflecting the farmer’s agency (e.g., diversification, farm                                 expansion, participation in agri-environmental programs), looking for correlations with                                 some indicator of farm resilience. Such data-driven approaches are often only indirectly                                 linked to theoretical frameworks, since they depend on the aspects of resilience that are                                 quantifiable and the availability of large data sets (see [62]).                                       Some studies take an interpretivist approach, aiming to capture a subjective understanding, i.e., why farmers do what they do. The focus is on individual meaning,                                 interpretation, motivations and values of farmers, and on taking into account contextual                                 factors since farmers’ choices are understood as being culturally situated. Such studies                                 often use in-depth interviews to ask farmers what disturbances they have perceived in the                                 past, and how they have coped with and adapted to changes. Some studies have compared                                 case studies from several countries (e.g., [63–65]), whereas others focus on a specific type                                 of farm within a region (e.g., [60,61,66–77]). Such studies have identified various ‘rules of                                 thumb’ or principles that farmers use to guide their choices, such as autonomy, cooperation,                                 or being flexible by adapting production practices, which can be linked to principles of                                 resilience derived from theoretical frameworks (see [40,78]).                                       Finally, some studies take a critical approach, focusing on social justice and human                                 emancipation, highlighting how resilience is political, i.e., how the way it is used and                                 implemented is imbued with specific interests by specific groups. Such studies are partly                                 based on interviews and partly on the analysis of documents, and usually focus on how the                                 concept of resilience is framed by various groups and how this framing constrains farmers                                 (e.g., [7,79,80]). Sustainability 2021, 13, 3387                                                                                             5 of 21
                                      Overall, the conventional approaches, whether from a positivist, interpretivist, or                                 critical leaning, implicitly convey that resilience is linked to the attributes a farm or a                                 farmer ‘has’. Although it is clear that a farm does not just ‘have’ a ’thing’ called autonomy                                 or diversity, in analytical practice it is often treated in much the same way. The identified                                 attributes or indicators are therefore assessed, and used to distinguish between farms that                                 are more or less resilient, as well as to derive normative recommendations on how farms                                 should be to ‘be’ resilient.                                       Some empirical studies hint at transformational change; however, they do not focus                                 on it. On the one hand this is because it is often difficult to define a clear and unambiguous                                 boundary between adaptative and transformative change, for that requires to define when                                 a system is ‘fundamentally’ different, and to operationalize it using the available data.                                 While conceptually it is possible to distinguish between, e.g., ‘input substitution’ and                                 ‘system redesign’ (see [81]), studies on the ‘conventionalization’ of organic farming have                                 shown how challenging this is to implement empirically given contextual diversity and                                 multiplicity (see, e.g., [82–84]). On the other hand, fundamental, transformative change is                                 expected to occur only occasionally, so that it is not always easy to find exemplars in the                                 sample of farms included in a particular study (see, e.g., [85]).
                                2.3. Farming Resilience from a Process-Relational Worldview                                        A relational approach is rooted in postmodern ontology, which rejects the modernist                                 search for universal principles, and which has deconstructed various aspects underlying                                 conventional approaches, not least by decentering the rational, autonomous subject as well                                 as rejecting the notion that things have an inherent ‘essence’ or intrinsic property [54]. The                                 relational approach is itself a diverse family of schools of thought (for a brief overview,                                 see [86]), but what they have in common is that they do not see entities as primary, focusing                                 instead on the relations between entities, since entities cannot be understood apart from                                 the relations that constitute them [87,88]. Thus, while conventional approaches tend to                                 posit discrete pre-given entities and use them as the starting point of analysis, searching                                 for ways in which they may be linked and how they may interact, in relational approaches                                 it is the dynamic, unfolding relations that become the primary unit of analysis [87,89].                                        Within this diverse family, the process-relational worldview has two specificities:                                 firstly, relations are understood as processes, rather than as concrete ties or static networks;                                 and secondly, all phenomena are understood as constituted through processes and dynamic                                 relations [90], i.e., entities themselves “have no substance beyond their associations and                                 intermeshed becomings” [91] (p. 25). To understand a relation as a process necessarily                                 implies movement and transformation. A process is work; it changes something, it produces difference [92]. Building, maintaining, and changing relations requires ongoing                                 effort; relations are laborious, contested, and uncertain [91,92]. Understanding relations as                                 ongoing processes not only emphasizes that change is ubiquitous, it also highlights the                                 ever-present potential of relations to become otherwise [93,94].                                        As relations are pervasive, they include both humans and nonhumans [90]. Indeed,                                 materials are involved in every relation between humans, we cannot exist outside of the                                 world of materials [91,95]. Overcoming the anthropocentric bias is particularly important in                                 the context of farming, which is fundamentally an entanglement, an assemblage of humans,                                 materials, technology, buildings, animals, and plants. Being constituted of processes,                                 matter is not understood as inert and passive. It is dynamic, ‘vibrant’ [96], has the capacity                                 to do work [92], and thus can have agentic effects [97]. Indeed, even if matter does not                                 have cognition or intentionality, it has potentialities, can avail, make possible, support,                                 can be effective, can prevent actions [91] (p. 67). The material aspects of a farm are thus                                 not understood as the passive and transparent means of human action [76]. While the                                 farmer may strive to assemble the farm in a specific way, this assemblage produces new                                 givens, intertwining relations anew, creating new conditions of possibility. As the farmer                                 influences but does not control processes, surprises are inevitable. Sustainability 2021, 13, 3387                                                                                             6 of 21
                                      A process-relational worldview emphasizes continually unfolding relations. It implies                                 a move away from seemingly solid, stable states or permanent ‘things’, ties, networks,                                 or structures, towards dynamic, unfolding processes, towards concepts such as relating,                                 associating, assembling, intertwining, and transforming [34,87,90,98]. This shift from ‘farm’                                 to ‘farming’, from nouns to verbs [37], is not innocent, for the words we use conjure                                 images that shape how we conceptualize and thus study phenomena. Indeed, nouns                                 connote a passive, stable, inert object, whereas verbs connote changing, transforming,                                 becoming [37,38,99].                                       Relations are heterogeneous and multiple; they are biological, material, technological,                                 social, emotional, cultural, political, symbolic, discursive; they are always and everywhere                                 contingent, contradictory, unfinished; and they do not settle around a ‘basin of attraction.’ Rather, like evolution, they are open-ended, replete with novelty and unexpected                                 changes [100]. Within this worldview, farms, farmers, and farming practices emerge from                                 relations that are constantly made and remade. These relations produce assemblages of                                 various duration, as some may last for a while and thus appear stable. Farming is thus                                 conceptualized as a bundle of processes, where structures are only apparently stable as                                 they can always be actualized differently [101]. Resilience is then not seen as a property,                                 attribute, or essence of a ‘stable’ farm; it is not a substance, a ‘thing’ that can be measured.                                 Rather, resilience continually emerges out of the configuration of tangible and intangible                                 relations and the ever-changing dynamics of these processes. In other words, a farm ‘is’                                 not resilient, but farming resilience is continuously made and re-made [99].                                       Resilience is then not about maintaining specific functions, structures, or feedbacks, or                                 about avoiding thresholds, it is about enabling ongoing, creative, and responsive change.                                 Indeed, given that the aspects of a system that confer resilience depend on context [102],                                 any one set of attributes cannot be an indicator of resilience, for that would imply a world                                 that is orderly and predictable. Yet, if the world is an ongoing flux of change, forever                                 shifting, the future can never be predicted well enough. The aim is then not to plan—which                                 usually goes hand-in-hand with a ‘command and control’ [103] approach to implement                                 that plan—but to take appropriate action [104]. Just like in evolution, what is ‘appropriate’,                                 i.e., what ‘works’, cannot be known beforehand, but emerges through an ongoing process                                 of tinkering [100].                                       This tinkering or bricolage can thus be contrasted to planning, which is built on                                 an engineering approach in worldview, epistemology, and practice [105,106]. While an                                 engineering approach assumes that the world is orderly and thus affords formal planning,                                 specified goals, and clear strategies to achieve them, bricolage is based on an intimate                                 knowledge of the resources available acquired over time, and the ability to make use                                 of potentials for associations. Bricolage is “an assemblage work that goes beyond preestablished planning and leads to the production of new situated knowledges, objects                                 and associations” [107] (p. 300); it is a continuous process of intertwining doing and                                 making sense (see [105,108,109]). Thus, while farmers certainly have aims and goals, e.g.,                                 regarding quality of life and preferred farming practices, how these are realized remains                                 open to opportunities as they emerge, and they may well change based on experiences and                                 learning processes.                                       This process-relational approach allows to shift the emphasis from understanding                                 resilience as being mainly about maintaining a system within a stability landscape, towards                                 enabling ongoing change. It shifts attention from what seems solid and stable, towards the                                 emerging preferences, interests, and needs of family members; changes in the perception                                 of what farming practices are desirable and how the bundle of activities can be adapted                                 to respond to some change or other; how mindsets evolve, enabling new opportunities to                                 be recognized and seized; and how shocks redirect the trajectory, often in surprising and                                 sometimes in transformative ways, as the various ecological, material, and social relations                                 do not quite unfold as expected or wished for.                                       From a process-relational approach, farming resilience is thus understood as a doing,                                 a response-ability; i.e., the ability to respond and to shape changes by navigating a bundle Sustainability 2021, 13, 3387                                                                                              7 of 21
                                of processes, sensing the potential within the current situation, which allows to recognize                                 the possibilities emerging from the internal and external dynamics in which farming is                                 entangled (see [110,111]). Resilience is then the ability to engage in or disengage from                                 various relations, incline propensities, shaping the unfolding processes in a promising                                 direction. It is the ability to constitute relations differently, opening new possibilities, new                                 becomings. It is the ability to question that which had been accepted as a permanent                                 and unchangeable ‘fact’, to recognize that such fixities are made and can thus be made                                 differently. It is an engagement that enables options for change to become visible, to                                 make new differences, to envision new relations, which may be material (i.e., production                                 practices), social (e.g., relations with extension agents, agricultural policies, and consumers),                                 or mental (e.g., beliefs, preferences and ways of seeing), and finding creative ways to bring                                 them about, to realize them. Clearly, this doing, this response-ability is not a given, is                                 never acquired once-and-for-all, can never be taken for granted, but emerges anew through                                 each engagement.                                       A process-relational approach highlights the ambiguity, indeterminacy, ambivalence,                                 and openness of real life, as well as the context-dependency and complexity of intertwined                                 processes. Indeed, each process is “far more contingent, incomplete and contestable in                                 both its characteristics and effects than is usually acknowledged” [112] (p. 34). A processrelational approach highlights that real life is full of unexpected, unforeseen, and disruptive                                 events, and each measure implemented to address the impact of such an event has itself                                 unexpected and unforeseen effects. Resilience can then not be prescribed recipe-like from                                 the outside; it is not tied to some specific farm structure or configuration of activities,                                 but emerges from an active engagement in the situation, guided by an understanding                                 of the dynamics driving the farming system, the agro-ecosystem, the economic system,                                 the social system; it is also guided by a sense of the possible that allows recognizing                                 opportunities afforded by the ever-changing situation on- and off-farm. Clearly, the                                 situation off-farm is important as it may afford more or less options, can be enabling or                                 (severely) constraining [29,79,80].                                       From a process-relational view, the distinction between adaptive and transformative                                 change can only be made in hindsight. Only then is it possible to assess whether a                                 succession of marginal changes led to the ‘incremental adaptation trap’ [27], or whether                                 the changes enabled a reorganization around a fundamentally different set of principles, of                                 feedbacks, and can therefore be labelled transformative. Indeed, as change processes are                                 open-ended, and their impact is context-dependent, it is unclear at the outset what any one                                 change will lead to. Change may contribute to the system staying on the current trajectory,                                 where what may appear different is little more than ‘old wine in new bottles’ (see [80]);                                 or it may be transformative as it leads to a new logic, a new mindset, a new bundle of                                 relations that guides farming.
Illustrating Two Understandings of Farm/Farming Resilience Based on an Interview
                                      The aim in this section is to illustrate the implications of the two worldviews on                                 resilience thinking: a conventional approach, which conceptualizes a farm as a solid                                 ‘thing’, and a process-relational approach, which conceptualizes farming as an ongoing                                 relational process. The aim is not to present a thorough analysis or specific findings about                                 farm/farming resilience. The aim is only to contrast two worldviews and thereby explore                                 the kinds of insights afforded by a process-relational approach to farming resilience, its ability to open up new ways of thinking, to encourage further conceptual and methodological                                 explorations (see [113]). As the aim is not to present an in-depth analysis but to contrast, the                                 presentation of both approaches will be schematic, focusing only on those characteristics                                 that are typical for each. Like a good caricature, the aim is to capture essential aspects,                                 rather than to explore details and nuances.                                       To illustrate the typical insights afforded by the two approaches, it is expedient to focus                                 on one interview as this avoids the influence of differences in farm structures, contexts, or                                 family composition. The interview was conducted in Salzburg, Austria, as part of a larger Sustainability 2021, 13, 3387                                                                                                   8 of 21
                                 project on resilience (see [114]). It was selected as the trajectory of the farm was particularly                                  rich, and the farmer was very forthcoming with details on his understanding of why things                                  unfolded the way they did (see full transcript in the Interview Transcript S1).                                        At the time of the interview in 2013, the farmer was 60 years old. He took over                                  the dairy farm from his father in 1979 while keeping his off-farm job. He was one of the                                  pioneers of organic farming in Salzburg, joining the organic farmer’s association in the early                                  1980s. In 1992, he became a full-time farmer as he took over the farm of his father-in-law.                                  As it had some crop land, he started growing root crops for direct marketing. By the time                                  he handed the farm over to his son in 2007, it had some 30 dairy cows, 27 ha agricultural                                  land, and 9 ha of forest.
                                 3.1. Insights Afforded by a Conventional Approach to Farm Resilience                                       The interview transcript was uploaded into Atlas.ti, a qualitative research software.                                  The transcript was coded using the ‘attributes of general resilience’ as proposed by the                                  framework of Meuwissen et al. [42]. Since this framework was designed for a farming system at the regional level, the concepts were adapted to the farm level, based on [30,40,115].                                  This led to five general attributes of resilience: diversity (response and functional), modularity (flexibility in allocation of resources), openness (social connectivity), tightness of                                  feedbacks (response-ability to changes in the farming system and material flows), and                                  system reserves (i.e., natural, economic and social capital). The main themes (Table 1)                                  summarize the codes used while coding the interview and give a succinct overview of the                                  manifold strategies the farmer used to strengthen the resilience of his farm.

Similarly, changes in activities were mostly driven by internal ‘shocks’, e.g., that he was                                   unexpectedly asked whether he would take over the farm of his father-in-law (who did not                                   get along with his son), or the prolonged illness of family members. Changes in activities                                   were also driven by family dynamics, e.g., his son being willing to take over the farm, Sustainability 2021, 13, 3387                                                                                               10 of 21
                                but only if he could specialize by disengaging from direct marketing. Despite the income                                 generated by this activity, he saw it as causing a too high labor load and thus impairing the                                 work–life balance.

Insights from a Conventional Analysis of Farm Resilience and Limitations Tied to Its                                 Underlying Worldview                                       Conventional analysis is guided by the desire to find generalized stories from a causal                                 or comparative perspective, looking for similarities and differences, either across a number                                 of farms or in relation to the literature. This approach to qualitative data analysis builds on                                 establishing theoretically grounded codes to analyze data, and the function of coding is in                                 summarizing content [119]. This enables the analyst to create a coherent and interesting                                 narrative that is bound by patterns and themes [113]. Coding using ready-made concepts                                 implies that the themes are understood to have a fixed meaning, i.e., they can be transferred                                 from one context to another [113,120].                                       The advantage of this approach is that it enables a comparison across farms and                                 across regional case studies; and with it the accumulation of evidence on the relative                                 importance of individual attributes, how they may be expressed, and how they impact                                 farm resilience, especially when focusing on the ability of farms to buffer shocks and                                 to implement adaptive change. It thus allows a standardization that fits well with the                                 dominant audit and accountability culture that privileges an instrumental, engineering                                 approach to social sciences. As such, the approach is well aligned with the demands for                                 evidence-based policy recommendations.                                       As the example of analyzing the interview shows, the major themes (Table 1) do                                 not come as a surprise. Even if their expression is somewhat specific to that farm, that                                 family, at that time, in that place, this context-specificity is not understood as essential,                                 since the aim is to identify generalizable results that may contradict, confirm, or expand                                 the insights from previous studies. It has led some authors (e.g., [39,119,120]) to point out                                 that much qualitative research produces little new knowledge, as researchers too seldom                                 venture beyond cataloguing data into pre-existing concepts, and fail to question established                                 understandings of the object of inquiry.                                       Indeed, in the analysis above, the focus is on identifying ‘facts’ (e.g., agricultural                                 practices, farm structure, and activity mix, see Figure 1), which are seen as attributes of the                                 farm and which can be used to assess whether or not it may be resilient. This analytical                                 stance implies an understanding of resilience as a ‘thing’ a farm can have, and which is                                 caused by other ‘things’, such as diversity, modularity, openness. Indeed, a farm that ‘has’                                 these attributes will be labelled resilient. These concepts are rooted in a substance ontology                                 and in a static worldview, which orients our thinking and thus constrain the kinds of issues                                 we can perceive [37,121].                                       Through presenting the results as a table (Table 1), the image conveyed is that each                                 attribute is a discrete item. Even if its acknowledged that the principles of resilience are                                 interdependent [78], this interdependence and its implications, e.g., trade-offs or contextualdependence, are rarely explored conceptually; nor are the challenges that interdependence                                 implies for the analysis of empirical data discussed in depth. Instead, the table conveys                                 that ‘diversity’ and ‘modularity’ are clearly defined ‘things’ that a farm can ‘have’, that                                 can be empirically assessed, measured unproblematically, possibly by operationalizing                                 them through different indicators, which are then aggregated. These attributes can then be                                 used to characterize and classify a farm. Ideally, if sufficient farms are analyzed, a list of                                 attributes will enable to derive evidence-based policies, as well as a ‘menu’ of ready-made                                 resilience-strategies that can be used as recommendations for farmers.                                       It thus seems that the expectations towards academic analysis and the writing of                                 scientific texts leads us to distort into clarity the fuzziness, ambiguity, and indeterminacy                                 that pervades life-as-it-is-lived [122]. Conventional scientific analysis can seem like a                                 sleight of hand, as it tends to make ambiguity and indeterminacy invisible, thereby creating                                 certainties, fixities. Sustainability 2021, 13, 3387                                                                                             11 of 21
                                      These fixities are reinforced by a static, time-less approach, i.e., an analysis that                                 collapses time, where there is no sense that ‘history matters’. Implicitly it is clear that there                                 is a sequence of discrete events (Figure 1), but this historical sequence is not understood as                                 essential. This justifies analysis through a snapshot-approach, which collapses time, where                                 the various attributes that can be identified, which have been implemented at any time, are                                 catalogued, irrespective of combinations, sequence, and context. There is no sense that an                                 attribute developed over time, or that this duration is of importance. The question is just                                 whether a farm ‘has’ the attribute or not, the antecedents or the subsequent implications                                 are not understood as relevant. The attributes are thus passive, static ‘things’, with no                                 side-effects, unrelated to other ‘things’ for their existence.                                       The conventional analysis allows to approach farm resilience in a way that is decontextualized and ahistorical. This conveys that the attributes can (and should) be implemented                                 on any farm, that they can be freely combined, and that this implementation is ‘instantaneous’. There is no sense that it may be challenging to implement all attributes at all                                 times, that farmers may need to carefully juggle trade-offs between them, that their implementation is an ever-dynamic process, which integrates revisited past experiences, current                                 preferences, and future expectations.
                                3.3. Farming Resilience from a Process-Relational Worldview: Juggling Intertwined Processes,                                 Ubiquitous Change, and an Ever-Uncertain Future                                        To implement a process-relational approach, it seems judicious to engage with postqualitative inquiry and its possibility to produce different knowledge and produce knowledge                                 differently [39]. Postqualitative inquiry, like many ‘posts’, invites deconstruction, i.e.,                                 the displacement of overdetermined existing concepts, so that something different can                                 be thought and done [120,123–125]. Rooted in postmodernism, postqualitative inquiry                                 challenges the notion of validity as correspondence to ‘truth’, since ‘truth’ is understood as                                 made by humans, spaces of visibility constructed by power/knowledge so as to frame our                                 seeing [126]. The key concern is thus no longer what is the ‘right’ way to go about collecting                                 and analyzing data, but what approach to inquiry allows to question the previously takenfor-granted and thus affords new insights. The focus is on what challenge our established                                 ways of thinking, what allows us to think of resilience differently. The ‘post’ thus does not                                 and cannot offer an alternative methodology, as it is itself a process of becoming, a process                                 where ‘data’ from the interview, from theory, from one’s immersion in a topic intermingle;                                 where writing is just as much part of the analysis, so that theorizing–thinking–writing are                                 intricately linked, rather than distinct steps [122,127,128].                                        The transcript was thus read with and through theory, to look for different narrative                                 flows underlying the ‘story’ of the farm’s becoming. The approach in this illustration is                                 still ‘humanist’ in that the focus is on processes as perceived by the farmer. Clearly, many                                 other processes (not least of which those driven by nonhumans) are concurrent and heavily                                 shape, intermingle, and interfere with those recounted by the farmer, but these are not                                 explored here to enable a closer comparison with the conventional method.                                        The processes can be explicit streams that explain the various ‘turning points’ as                                 perceived by the farmer, such as the pivotal role of the ever-changing availability of                                 family labor, or implicit streams, such as shifts in on-farm nutrient flows through the                                 engagement in composting and then conversion to organic farming. The processual                                 character is conveyed by avoiding static nouns—as far as the English language will allow—                                 for verbs that denote activity and change. Thus, it is no longer about a farm as a static                                 entity that ‘is’ large or small, or which ‘has’ specific attributes; it is about farming as an                                 open process of becoming.

Moreover, what seems                                      feasible and desirable depends on changing social, material, economic, or policy processes                                      in the broader context.                                            So certainly, resilience attributes such as ‘diversity’, ‘modularity’, and ‘openness’                                      are recognizable in the interview. However, these are analytical abstractions that can be Sustainability 2021, 13, 3387                                                                                             13 of 21
                                identified in retrospect. It is unclear if they can be identified when standing in the midst                                 of a multitude of emerging and intertwined processes, i.e., if they are helpful guides for                                 future-oriented decisions. As the philosopher Søren Kierkegaard put it succinctly: “Life                                 can only be understood backwards, but it must be lived forward.”                                       In this particular interview, the farmer looked back over the 25 years of his farming                                 career and identified a number of principles that he kept in mind, e.g., ‘invest but avoid                                 a too high debt load’, ‘maintain several income streams’, or ‘keep in touch with what                                 consumers want and what other farmers are doing’. However, while he broadly adhered                                 to such principles, they did not ensure the resilience of his farming. Indeed, he overlooked                                 the cumulative impact of diversification, especially linked to direct marketing, on the                                 workload, which became too high as his mother-in-law became ill and required ongoing                                 care. This led to severely straining both his wife’s and his own mental health. Witnessing                                 his parents’ high workload and poor quality of life almost discouraged his son to take                                 over the farm. Faced with this crisis, the farmer had to revisit a deeply held conviction:                                 that the income from direct marketing was essential to secure the economic viability of                                 the farm. Revisiting this conviction was a painful process as he had invested much energy                                 in developing the network, and it took him a while to revise what was ‘thinkable’. In                                 hindsight, at the time of the interview, he acknowledged that accepting his son’s decision                                 and exiting direct marketing was the right choice, for it increased the wellbeing of all family                                 members, ensured succession, and opened new possibilities.                                       This is not only an example of the challenges to juggle different principles for farming                                 resilience, but also of how change processes can remain invisible for a while as they                                 incubate and mature, before they emerge at a favorable moment, when the shifting relations                                 are conducive and can be nudged in a way that further transforms relations between                                 various mental, social, ecological, material, or economic processes, so that a new system is                                 actualized in the farm structure.                                       As this interview shows, how each activity unfolded over time was a complex, unpredictable, multifaceted process, replete with unexpected side-effects that required ongoing                                 adjustments. The farming trajectory was also marked by surprises, both internal (especially                                 prolonged illnesses by family members) and external, not least the development of organic                                 farming, and the radical changes of agricultural policies and markets following EU accession. Within the trajectory that emerged from the intertwining of the unfolding activities                                 and the response to surprises, several turning points can be labeled transformative, as they                                 profoundly changed the logic that guided choices, a new way of thinking and of organizing                                 activities, and the resulting material, social, and experiential relations. The first was the conversion to organic farming, the second the shift induced by taking over the father-in-law’s                                 farm and becoming a full-time farmer, and the third the restructuring of the farm when                                 preparing the handing-over to his son. These were a culmination of previous processes,                                 and resulted in fundamental shifts in the structure, identity, and feedbacks underlying                                 farming processes. They led to different flows of nutrients, experiences, knowledge, as                                 well as different economic and social relations. Much like the family succession process, it                                 is to some extent arbitrary to set a point in time where a transformation took place, as it is                                 rooted in a number of earlier processes, and its unfolding is ongoing.
                                3.4. Insights from a Process-Relational Approach to Farming Resilience, and Openings Afforded by                                 the Underlying Worldview                                      By focusing on processes, farming becomes much more fluid, changing, an ongoing                                 tinkering, adapting, transforming, and becoming. It dissolves the image of the farm as                                 determined by manifold social structures, economic imperatives, and externally prescribed                                 production techniques. It dissolves the illusion of production practices as routine, as                                 sameness and repetition, highlighting that change is present at all times, that routines                                 are dynamic [130], that no day is exactly as the previous one. Overall, the changes that                                 were actualized tended to proceed in bursts, in ebbs and flows, where several processes                                 suddenly aligned, often unpredictably, creating a need for change, opening a new space of                                 possibility, enabling a new perception of opportunities. Sustainability 2021, 13, 3387                                                                                            14 of 21
                                     These ongoing change processes are not so much enabled by the farm ‘having’ a                                 pre-defined set of attributes (Table 1), but these attributes emerge from being able to discern                                 how to engage in the current situation, from being creative in finding ways to benefit from                                 the current dynamics. It might thus be more helpful to view the attributes as emerging                                 from processes. It is similar to riding a bicycle: the rider does not ‘have’ equilibrium,                                 enabling her/him to balance on two narrow wheels. Rather, equilibrium can emerge from                                 pedaling, from the movement, from skillfully engaging with the process, being responseable to the unevenness of the road or a dog suddenly crossing the street. Building and                                 maintaining resilience is then less about applying the attributes or principles in a ‘rationalcomprehensive’ way, and more about enabling an open-ended process of ‘muddling                                 through’ [131] by engaging with the potentials and pitfalls of the current situation.                                      This means that the trajectory of a farm over time is not the implementation of a                                 carefully planned strategy, built on the optimal use of available resources and a careful                                 operationalization of resilience attributes. Rather, it is a bricolage, shaped by many unexpected events, some of which will require a fundamental revisiting of past relations, be it                                 mental models or how material resources are used. Thus, no matter how carefully planned                                 a project may be, many processes outside of the control of the farmer will influence how it                                 will actually unfold. The key to resilience, to persistence over the long term, is then not                                 to plan ever more carefully, but to remain response-able, to nurture the ability to engage                                 in processes as they unfold in a creative way. Sailing might be an appropriate metaphor:                                 the helmswoman has a goal in mind, but to reach it, she needs to engage flexibly with the                                 wind and the current, building on and revising past experiences, knowing how her boat                                 responds and managing her energy (see [132]). This engagement is not just a response to                                 external processes, but an active engagement to shift propensities, to shape opportunities,                                 to make a preferred unfolding more likely than other potential unfoldings (see [133]).                                      This highlights that there is no inevitability in how the farm trajectory unfolded; it                                 could just as well have unfolded very differently. Many choices, large and small, were                                 made, each of which could have been made differently. This does not mean that the farmer                                 could shape relations and processes at will, since the farmer can influence processes but can                                 never control them [92]. Yet, there is no determinism stemming from the structure of the                                 family, of the farm, its resources, and its ecological, social, or political context. The future                                 is indeterminate, with relations that are made and remade in an ongoing, open-ended                                 process [34].
Conclusions                                      Resilience is a concept that focuses on the ability of a system to persist through change.                                 As such, it foregrounds change both in the context and in the system itself. In his seminal                                 paper, Holling [32] emphasized the unpredictable nature of these change dynamics and                                 the need to keep options open. Yet, this uncertainty and unpredictability can be at odds                                 with the dominant substantialist worldview, with the disciplinary norms in academia, as                                 well as with the audit and accountability culture, all of which value clear and unequivocal                                 evidence-based recommendations, preferably derived from the purported authority of                                 quantitative models. This worldview has a tendency to create fixities by conveying that                                 the future will, by and large, unfold in a predictable manner, which can be known well                                 enough based on the past. Building on this worldview, the conceptual approaches and                                 methods used to operationalize resilience thinking at the farm level have a tendency to                                 focus on risk-management strategies to enable farms to cope with shocks resulting from the                                 vagaries of markets or the impacts of climate change. By focusing on how to maintain the                                 system within its current basin of attraction, its current trajectory, this approach implicitly                                 sidelines—and possibly impairs—transformative change.                                      Yet, arguably, amidst the climate emergency, the mounting ecological, social, economic, and political crises, we might well need to put more emphasis on identifying ways                                 towards a transformative change of the techno-scientific regimes of exploitation, focused                                 on consumption and profitability, that characterize the Anthropocene [12,13,134]. I argue Sustainability 2021, 13, 3387                                                                                            15 of 21
                                that taking a postmodern approach to resilience thinking can be a contribution to this                                 broader undertaking. Engaging with the ontological turn, experimenting with the tools of                                 postqualitative inquiry may enable to foreground opportunities for transformative change                                 in farming, not least by transforming our research practices. By opening new ways to do                                 social inquiry, by pressing against the limits of inherited images, we might create a jolt in                                 the habits of mind, a productive turbulence of thinking, creating conceptual openings [135].                                 The aim is not to shift from an overdetermined present to an equally overdetermined future,                                 but to open possibilities for different becomings, to open the space for theoretical, empirical,                                 and methodological experimentation, avoiding a foreclosing in predefined categories of                                 what counts as ‘research’ just as much as what counts as a ‘resilient’ farm. The aim is to                                 make explicit the spaces opened up when certainties are questioned, when the unthinkable                                 becomes a possibility, when fixities are dissolved into flows, when ambiguities show that it                                 could be otherwise. The aim is to liberate diversity, opening up a constraining structure so                                 that something different might happen [39].                                        Clearly, engaging in postqualitative research is risky, as it works against the normalizing tendency of research to reduce knowledge-making to step-by-step guidelines, with                                 clear procedures to ensure validity [126–128]. It is risky because while there are no set                                 methodological rules, this does not mean that ‘anything goes’; risky because the outcome                                 is uncertain, so there is not guarantee that anything valuable will come of it. However,                                 openly acknowledging the complexity of the research process might be a risk worth taking,                                 if it allows us to think differently.                                        I argue that a process-relational worldview can foreground transformative change                                 within resilience thinking. By highlighting how the trajectory of a farming system unfolds                                 in unpredictable ways, it conveys that the future can be just as surprising, that it does                                 not need to be a continuation of the past. This creates conceptual openings. It enables                                 new imaginaries. It guides the analysis not only towards the heterogenous processes                                 that converged to engender surprises in the past, but also towards the daily choices that                                 contribute to maintain trajectories—choices that can be made differently, thus possibly                                 opening the way for transformative change. As the future is indeterminate, there can never                                 be a guarantee for how change will unfold, yet one might incline propensities (see [133]).                                 Rather than starting with a preconceived plan, intent on applying willpower to inert matter,                                 it might be more fruitful to make the most of what is, attending to the way a process                                 unfolds, growing its potentials, detecting a configuration of relations that is favorable to                                 the task at hand [104,133].                                        This shift in emphasis within resilience, from ‘maintaining the system’ towards shaping transformative change, is enabled by a shift in ontological commitments and the                                 concomitant epistemological implications. Appraising farming resilience is then less about                                 measuring the ‘hard facts’ of a farm, assessing whether its structure reflects a set of attributes, e.g., whether it has a pre-defined level of diversity or autonomy. It is more about                                 identifying the mental, social, economic, and material relations that enable or impede                                 open-ended change processes.                                        A process-relational worldview can contribute to open up what has been foreclosed                                 and simplified. If farming resilience is conceptualized as emerging out of the ever-changing                                 configurations of tangible and intangible relations, as being continuously remade, then                                 strengthening resilience is about enabling ongoing, situated, creative, responsive change.                                 A process-relational approach to resilience can thus contribute to expand conceptual                                 imaginaries and encourage empirical experimentation, not least be exploring the role of                                 material agency (see, e.g., [136–140]).                                        By briefly contrasting two readings of an interview, I show how our academic practices                                 can reinforce seeming fixities and inevitabilities, by using an approach that builds on                                 determinism, structures, order, and clarity, by assuming matter to be inert and passive, with                                 human willpower as the only source of change. It is unsurprising that recommendations                                 derived from such research contributes to policies that strengthen the ability of farms to                                 buffer shocks, to remain within the current trajectory, thereby constraining transformative Sustainability 2021, 13, 3387                                                                                                        16 of 21
                                   change (see [80,141,142]). Contrasting the two readings shows that the worldview that                                    guides how we operationalize concepts such as resilience are not innocent choices we                                    make as researchers. This choice informs what we focus on when interpreting empirical                                    data, what conclusions we draw, and what recommendations we derive from them. As                                    Feldman et al. [130] (p. 512) point out: “if you start with an ontology that assumes stability,                                    you can never see change, or the possibilities for change.” Clearly, the choice of theoretical                                    framing can either contribute to create fixities and maintain the status quo, or it can                                    highlight openings for change (see [143,144]).                                         If we want to enable transformative change on farms and in agro-food systems more                                    broadly, we must revisit the assumptions, beliefs, and commitments that have created                                    the current system (see [145]). We must become critically aware of implicit ontological                                    and epistemological assumptions in conventional approaches, and find ways to ask new                                    questions and look at empirical material with fresh eyes.
