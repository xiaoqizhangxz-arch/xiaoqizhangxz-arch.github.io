This paper addresses this issue through the application of theoretical work on ordering, which focuses on the materially heterogeneous processes and                                                        implicit strategies that hold together and perform particular social and organisational arrangements. Keywords: Adoption                                                        Drawing upon qualitative data from a research project on adoption of precision agriculture (PA) in the Ordering                                               Australian rice industry, we identify two principal modes of ordering: (1) commercial-technological, in Materiality                                            which lack of compatibility between technologies produced by different machinery manufacturers Technology                                             creates challenges for farmers in integrating and adapting PA to existing farming practices and systems; Farming knowledge                                      and (2) biophysical, where drought and low water allocations create uncertainty and a reluctance by Precision agriculture                                  farmers to make large capital outlays for PA technology. While these modes of ordering constrain rice                                                        growers’ capacities to adopt PA technology, we argue that growers also engage in their own alternative                                                        ordering practices to negotiate, work with, and work around these constraints. We refer to this work as                                                        tinkering and argue that it is a powerful, yet little recognised, form of ordering enabling growers to take                                                        advantage of the material beneﬁts of PA in a way that is ﬂexible, adaptable, and ﬁts their immediate                                                        farming circumstances.

An analytical emphasis on socio-                         care-based ethic rather than simply reacting to ﬁnancial opportumaterial ordering, which we apply in this paper, builds on                         nities, imperatives and constraints’. Similarly, Bohnet et al. (2011, p. growing engagement with a relational approach in agi-food                          635) argue that ‘graziers are motivated by pursuing personal studies, which is characterised by attention to ‘how materialities,                values’, and policies and extension programmes are unlikely to be practices and discourses matter in terms of their effects and af-                  effective if they ‘do not take graziers’ values and motivations into fectivities’ (Carolan, 2017, p. 136).                                              consideration’. An important insight from this literature is that     Drawing from a qualitative study of technology adoption in the                 individual values and goals underpinning farm practices are located Australian rice industry, this article investigates the modes of                   within broader farming cultures, providing farmers with a sense of ordering that inﬂuence how growers come to know and engage                         meaning and identity (Burton, 2004; Burton et al., 2008; with precision agriculture (PA). Broadly, PA refers to a range of                  Sutherland and Burton, 2011). For example, Burton (2004, p. 210) techniques e such as yield monitoring and mapping, remote                          contends that agricultural landscapes are ‘highly symbolic envisensing, and variable rate technology e that utilise technologies                  ronments where the social value of production must be considered including Global Positioning Systems and Geographic Information                    on a par with economic value’. Particular farming practices Systems. As a suite of technologies, PA is argued to contribute ‘to                generate ‘symbolic capital and socio-cultural rewards’ and are the long-term sustainability of production agriculture’ through                    strongly associated with being recognised as a ‘good farmer’ more targeted and strategic use of inputs that ‘reduce losses from                 (Warren et al., 2016, p. 179). Whether or not a new innovation or excess applications and from reduction of losses’ due to nutrient                  practice is consistent with notions of good farming therefore has a imbalances, weed escapes and insect damage (Bongiovanni and                        strong inﬂuence on farmer adoption decisions. Lowenberg-DeBoer, 2004, p. 383). An ordering approach draws                            Recognising that farmers' goals and values are an important attention to the heterogeneous sets of relations and implicit stra-                feature of broader farming cultures, social researchers have also tegies through which PA is enacted, without assuming that these                    examined the role of farming knowledge in the implementation of relations are necessarily ‘social’ or ‘cultural’. It also provides                 new practices, innovations, or government programmes. This broader insights into the variously enabling and constraining ef-                  literature broadly emphasises the need to understand and take into fects engendered by these sets of relations. Based on our analysis,                account farmers' tacit and experiential knowledge. Failure to do so we identify two principal modes of ordering PA: commercial-tech-                   contributes to farmers' loss of trust in scientiﬁc and government nological and biophysical. We argue that while these forms of                      institutions and difﬁculties for authorities in achieving farmer ordering have a generally constraining effect on rice growers' un-                 engagement or adoption (Clark and Murdoch, 1997; Wynne, 1996). derstanding of how PA can work for them, and their capacities to                   Farming knowledge is in some respects distinctive from ‘scientiﬁc’ implement PA on-farm, growers also engage in their own alterna-                    knowledge (Murdoch and Clark, 1994; Winter, 1997). Yet, at the tive ordering practices e which we refer to as tinkering e to                      same time, the two forms of knowledge are related. As Riley (2008) negotiate, work with, and work around these constraints. Tinkering                 argues, farmers are ‘experts in their own ﬁelds’ (p. 1288); their is partly a consequence of the material constraints imposed by                     experience-led understandings and practices provide important commercial-technological and biophysical modes of ordering.                        insights into farm management, but these ‘are often beyond the However, it is also a practical strategy for growers in caring for their           reach of techniques and records of elite science’ (p. 1291).

While social science research on farm-level adoption is diverse,                   Applied speciﬁcally to PA, a relational approach to knowledge is it is broadly united in taking a ‘socio-cultural’ approach e the                   best exempliﬁed in the work of Tsouvalis et al.

Through a case study of two                 ordering is located, is distinctive in taking a relational approach to farming areas in the UK, Tsouvalis et al. show how farmers contest                  materiality e termed relational materialism. As Law (1999, p. 4) and negotiate this knowledge-culture by questioning: (a) the use-                   notes, ANT takes the relationality of entities, ‘the notion that they fulness of yield maps e particularly their capacity to reveal issues                are produced in relations, and applies this ruthlessly to all matewith yield variability of which farmers were not already aware e                    rials’. This involves extending analysis beyond just human agents and (b) the capacity of yield mapping to improve the accuracy of                    and ‘social’ relations to encompass heterogeneous materials in the fertiliser applications, and enhance yields.                                        patterning of the social.     The heuristic of ‘knowledge-cultures’, and a relational approach                    An analytic of ordering also highlights the challenges posed by to knowledge more broadly, is signiﬁcant in highlighting the dy-                    material relations and entities in integrating farming knowledge namic and ﬂuid relationship between seemingly distinct forms of                     with other knowledge-cultures. The challenges involved in knowledge, as well as the ways in which farmers contest, adapt to                   knowledge integration are well documented (e.g., Clark and and accommodate, different knowledge-cultures. From this                            Murdoch, 1997; Ingram, 2008b; Tsouvalis et al., 2000). Nevertheperspective, farmers' adoption decisions are conceptualised as an                   less, it is often assumed that these can be overcome through the effect of how different knowledge-cultures are constituted and                      development of programmes, processes, or decision-support sysrelate to one another. However, to date the main emphasis has been                  tems that encourage farmer participation in knowledge building, on the social and cultural relations through which farming knowl-                   joint learning, and the sharing of decision-making power edge is produced and intersects with other knowledges. This                         (Bruckmeier and Tovey, 2008; Oliver et al., 2012; Raymond et al., overlooks the important ways in which knowledge building is a co-                   2010). From an ordering perspective, human agency, knowledge, production involving ‘the social dimensions of cognitive commit-                    and organisation is generated ‘in a network of heterogeneous maments and understandings … and the epistemic and material cor-                      terials’ (Law, 1994, p. 25, emphasis in original). Consequently, difrelates of social formations’ (Jasanoff, 2004, p. 3). Similarly, it also            ferences between knowledge-cultures, or a focus on knowledge as overlooks how (farming) knowledge, and the practices informed by                    the main object of analytical attention, is not necessarily the main and produced through that knowledge, is ‘a product or an effect of a                issue in understanding how to improve farmer engagement with, network of heterogeneous materials’ (Law, 1992, p. 381). We argue                   and adoption of, programmes or technologies. Greater scrutiny is that an analytical focus on ‘ordering’ enables identiﬁcation of the                 needed of the ‘heterogeneous assemblages of materials, technolosocio-materially heterogeneous processes of co-production                           gies, and people’ (Knox et al., 2008, p. 871) that comprise different through which PA is constituted as an object of farming knowl-                      modes of ordering, and how these ‘work and relate in different edge.

However, farmers' engagement with new technologies analytical dimensions that make it different from the traditional                   and practices is viewed primarily as a product of their experiential/ sociological emphasis on social order. First, ordering recognises that              tacit knowledge and the farming culture(s) within which they are ‘orders are never complete’ and that they ‘are more or less pre-                    located. In contrast, the idea of ordering enables a focus on how carious and partial accomplishments’ (pp. 1e2). Second, processes                   farming knowledge and practices are a contingent effect of multiple of ordering are plural, co-existing with one another. This means                    modes of ordering that ‘work in different ways to open up or close there is no such thing as a singular or root order through which the                down possibilities’ (Anderson et al., 2012, p. 172). While different social world can be explained. Third, ordering is not simply ‘social’;              modes of ordering may co-exist side-by-side, they can also, as Mol ‘what we call the social is materially heterogeneous’ comprising                    and Law (2002, p. 10) argue, ‘overlap and interfere with one ‘talk, bodies, texts, machines, architectures’ (p. 2, emphasis in                   another’. This means, according to Moser (2005, p. 669, emphasis in original). Widely applied in science and technology studies,                        original), that ‘in practice, people are not caught in any one mode of research using the notion of ordering has focused on the hetero-                    ordering’, but ‘rather slip and move between multiple modes of geneous processes of assembling and dis-assembling through                          ordering that coexist, are partially related in complex ways, and which phenomena such as bridges (Suchman, 2000), airports                           even folded into each other’. As a consequence, even if the overall (Knox, O'Doherty, Vurdubakis and Westrup, 2008), subway signs                       effect of ordering is to reinforce the dominance of particular actors (Denis and Pontille, 2015), biosecurity surveillance (Donaldson and                 or arrangements, there is always an openness to ordering that Wood, 2008), and disabilities (Moser, 2005) are performed and                       enables alternative possibilities for agency, identity and organisaheld together.

Signiﬁcantly, we argue                             including livestock, cotton, nuts or citrus. that such constraints have little to do with differences in forms of                            The data discussed in this article forms part of a broader project knowledge or knowledge-cultures. They arise from the ways in                                funded by the Australian Rural Industries Research and Developwhich materials and material entities e software, machines and                              ment Corporation (RIRDC).

Drawing on Moser's (2005, p. 689)                          increase the effectiveness of technology adoption. Since the inargument that ‘there is an important form of openness in the ma-                            dustry is seeking to promote wider uptake of PA by growers, this terial practice of ordering’, we also investigate the alternative                           comprised a key focus of the research.

To date, ordering has been                             widely adopted by farmers in the Australian rice industry. However, applied primarily at the meso-level of medium to large sized or-                            it is the quality rather than the rate of adoption that is the critical ganisations and agencies (e.g., Knox et al., 2008; Law, 1994; K.                            issue. That is to say, while farmers have been adopting PA techWilkinson, 2011a,b). Consequently, there has been limited analysis                          nology, our early discussions with industry stakeholders indicated of how ordering works in practice at more micro-levels such as                              that many farmers were not taking advantage of the full beneﬁts farms. Through the notion of ‘tinkering’ (Law, 2010; Mol, 2008), we                         that the technology offers. For example, we were told by one show how the constraints posed by material modes of ordering                                stakeholder of a farmer who had installed yield mapping software contribute to alternative ordering strategies by growers in making                          on his tractor, but did not record the data collected.
