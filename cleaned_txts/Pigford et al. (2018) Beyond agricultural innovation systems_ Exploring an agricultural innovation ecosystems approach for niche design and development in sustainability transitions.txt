Thus, these spaces in                    within which they form the (innovation) ecosystem (Jackson, 2011; which the direction and actual unfolding of innovation is negotiated                        Shaw and Allen, 2016). can gradually reconﬁgure regimes to support broad change (Bui et al.,                           Innovation Ecosystems thinking can help to expand the types of 2016).

Such boundaries can be between scales in the proaches such as actor-network theory (Latour, 2005; Chen and Hung,                 agricultural systems in transition, between the technological paradigms 2016; Watts and Scales, 2015) and have been linked to transition stu-               or normative orientation of diﬀerent innovation niches, and between dies (Diaz et al., 2013; Svensson and Nikoleris, 2018).

This is explicitly recognized in several alternative agrireinforced and intrinsically embedded in approaches that emphasize                  culture innovation niches. For example, agroecology has long sought to human-environment relationships, like agroecological and social-eco-                integrate multiple scales in order to advance innovation and scaling of logical systems thinking (Foran et al., 2014; Pant, 2015; Ollivier et al.,          novel agroecological systems (Dalgaard et al., 2003). Additionally, 2018; Sinclair et al., 2014). In these approaches the material aspects of           ‘smart’ farming (also called digital farming) works on the premise that the system are seen as drivers of innovation (e.g. by biomimicry- see               it enables real time connections between diﬀerent scales in agricultural Blok and Gremmen, 2016; Stojanovic, 2017), but can also be relevant in              production, processing, commercialization, and consumption processes the context of other approaches such as ‘smart’ farming, in which cyber-            (Eastwood et al., 2017; Wolfert et al., 2017), which may also enable physical systems note a direct connection between ecological produc-                circularity due to the integration of information, energy and material tion process, information ﬂows, and system optimization (Eastwood                   ﬂows. While AIS does consider scale, by considering actors and their et al., 2017; Wolfert et al., 2017), or in circular bioeconomy approaches           relationships at diﬀerent scales of agricultural systems (e.g. spatial: in which certain material ﬂows act as linking pins that connect diﬀerent            village, country; and innovations: crop, technology) (Kilelu et al., 2013) sectors (Borrello et al., 2016). Therefore, for sustainable agricultural            and recognizing the role of actors beyond agricultural production innovation the broadest range of actors and actants needs to be con-                chains (e.g. ﬁnancial sector, civil society) (Klerkx et al., 2010), it seems sidered, since the interactions between multiple actors and actants can             that Innovation Ecosystems thinking is more explicit on the need to shape the ability of other actors to innovate (Touzard et al., 2015; Watts          continuously move between and adaptively engage with diﬀerent scales and Scales, 2015).                                                                  to consider emergent eﬀects due to feedback loops between scales (see     Ecological actants are present across agriculture-related sectors and           Table 1; also note that AIS has touched on this in studies taking a could also act as a unifying feature to link the various complex systems            complex adaptive systems perspective – Hall and Clark, 2010; Klerkx governing natural resource management sectors and ecosystem services                et al., 2010).

Thus, one key implication of the expanded range of                  multifunctionality and circularity of resources are key considerations in actors and actants is that there is a need to better consider the ecolo-            the transition to sustainable agricultural systems.

Since ecolo-               toral divides within agriculture due to specialization (e.g. separation of gical dimensions have the ability to co-shape emergent regimes (e.g.                crop and livestock sectors) have long hindered enacting multifunctional energy transitions – see Sutherland et al., 2015), it has the inherent              approaches to agriculture and functional cross-overs with non-agriability to exercise change by acting as an agent that impacts feedback              cultural sectors (Brooks and Loevinsohn, 2011; Hassink et al., 2013, loops in systems in ﬂux.
