                                                      a b s t r a c t Keywords:                                             This article uses the evolving understandings of commercial organic agriculture within two research Organic agriculture                                   programmes in New Zealand to address three problematic claims and associated framings that have Commercialisation                                                       underpinned analysis of the political economy of commercial organic agriculture. These three framings Conventionalisation Bifurcation                                                       are: 1) that recent commercial developments in organic agriculture have become organised around New Zealand                                           a grand binary of large-scale, corporate, industrialised organic agriculture that is inhabited by pragmatic Enactive research                                     newcomers to the industry, against a small-scale, local, authentic remnant of the original organic social Ontology                                              movement. This grand binary is most popularly recognisable in the claim by author Michael Pollan of the Metric-centric audit                                  existence of an ‘Organic Industrial Complex’ that is slowly subsuming authentic organic agriculture. This                                                       relates to claim 2) that commercialisation creates inevitable pressures by which organic agriculture                                                       becomes ‘conventionalised’. Finally, claim 3) positions organic agriculture alone as the only option for                                                       enabling improved environmental outcomes in agriculture. The Greening Food and ARGOS research                                                       programmes in New Zealand have studied the emergence of commercial forms of organic and other                                                       ‘sustainable’ agriculture in the period since 1995. A series of key engagements are highlighted in the                                                       unfolding history of these two programmes which demonstrate moments of transition in understandings                                                       of commercial organic, particularly in relation to situations of engagements between the research team                                                       and wider actors in the organic sector. These key engagements establish a clear sense in which the three                                                       major framings around the political economy of organic commercialisation could not explain the                                                       unfolding dynamics of the New Zealand organic sector. Rather, engagement with diverse actors enabled                                                       a whole new set of theoretical questions that opened up new areas of politics, contestation and elaboration of commercial forms of organic agriculture e particularly around shifts in power to the retail end                                                       of the agri-food chain, around new forms of agri-food governance, and around the politics of new audit                                                       systems. Within these shifts, the ontology of some of the researchers within these projects underwent                                                       parallel transformation. These transformative inﬂuences operated in two simultaneous directions. While                                                       the engaged research strategy of the two programmes clearly discomforted the researchers’ underlying                                                       assumptions for framing the major trajectories of commercial organic development, the presence of the                                                       two research programmes also had an important enactive power in the sector by both rendering                                                       ‘thinkable’ particular trajectories and economic experiments and also by reinforcing a ‘metric-centric’                                                       tendency in the evolution of global environmental audit systems. Seen in this light, these engagements                                                       open up new questions about the research programmes themselves in terms of the emerging politics of                                                       what Philip Lowe describes as a more ‘enactive’ rural sociology and help direct attention to an emerging                                                       ‘ontological turn’ in the practice and politics of research.
