In this paper we advance the conceptualisation of the ‘good farmer’ through integration of Bourdieusian concepts with DeLanda’s assemblage theory. Considering new farms as assemblages is useful to unlock the relative power of association amongst component parts, and to understand what drives the emergence of a farm. Utilising an empirical case study of new entrants to crofting in Scotland, we assess the interlinked processes of new symbolic capital formation and new croft establishment. Following Bourdieu, the ‘good farmer’ concept provides an approach to identify how established and shifting norms of crofting shape new holding establishment. Findings develop the materiality of social and cultural capital formation, with ‘good crofting’ ideals coded in relation to land capacity, practical experiences working the farm, multifunctional transitions and crofting legislation. New entrants actively ‘territorialise’ (define) their crofts by integrating new markets and management practices. The historicity of new farm assemblage is evident in the active mobilisation of historic images to inform expectations of pro­ ductivity. The authors argue that integration of assemblage theory with Bourdieusian concepts elucidates the flexibility of farming forms and identities, the role of ‘more-than-human’ actants in farming identity construction, and the role of legislation in shaping understanding of what farming should entail. This is important for academics and policy makers alike concerned with the efforts to revitalise rural and agrarian economies.
Introduction                                                                               central in models of farmer decision making, particularly in pursuit of                                                                                               understanding why farmers may be resistant to change (e.g. Burton     Over the past 15 years, the concept of the ‘good farmer’ has informed                     et al., 2008; Burton and Paragahawewa 2011; Riley et al., 2018). In the a substantial body of literature addressing the symbolic nature of                            good farmer literature, farming identity is conceptualised as resilient: farming practices (Burton et al., 2021). Burton’s seminal article (Burton,                    symbols of good farming are embedded in long term practices and farm 2004) was emblematic of the ‘cultural turn’ in rural studies and social                       household socialisation (i.e. socialised in childhood and thus transferred science more broadly (see Cloke, 1997), which moved away from                                 between generations). Common symbols include even, weed free fields; behavioural research focused on attitudes and values, and into con­                           healthy, well-conformed livestock; and tidy farmsteads. Loss of ability to ceptualisation of unconscious socialisation processes and identity for­                       demonstrate these symbols – for example through adoption of mation. The basic premise of the good farmer concept is that farmers                          agri-environmental measures (Burton et al., 2008), transition to gain symbolic capital from demonstrating skilled role performance,                            part-time farming (Sutherland, 2019) or retirement (Riley, 2016) – has a which is evident to themselves and other farmers in the visual repre­                         cultural cost to farmers. Farmers thus resist these transitions, even sentations of their practices (e.g. even, single crop fields, Burton et al.,                  though the changes may appear to be financially advantageous. 2021). Being seen as a ‘good farmer’ is thus not about public perception                          Recent research has demonstrated that these symbols can change or an objective measure of farming practices, but a distinction made                          over time, through devaluation of existing symbols, reflexivity and amongst farming peers. Recent literature has demonstrated the utility                         adaptation to new ‘rules of the game’ in farming and associated fields and breadth of applications for the concept, branching out from its                           (Sutherland and Darnhofer, 2012; Sutherland, 2013; Saunders, 2016; initial orientation towards understanding agri-environmental behaviour                        Cusworth 2020). Sutherland (2013) argued that good farming symbols (e.g. Burton et al., 2008; Huttunen and Peltomaa, 2016; Saunders,                             are also symbols of profitable farming, demonstrating Bourdieu’s ‘taste 2016), into organic farm conversion (Sutherland and Darnhofer, 2012;                          of necessity’ Bourdieu (1984): cultural embedded preferences for what Sutherland, 2013), livestock husbandry and veterinary practice (Naylor                        is within economic reach of the population (e.g. cheap, high fat foods for et al., 2018; Shortall et al., 2018), farmer aging and gender relations                       those of limited means). Farmers participate in economic ‘fields’ with (Riley, 2016) and into riparian zones (Thomas et al., 2019) and fishing                       associated rules: weed-free fields are evidence of skilled role perfor­ (Gustavsson et al., 2017).                                                                    mance in tillage and pesticide application, but also of higher yields that     In applied research, the dynamics of being a good farmer are seen as                      (historically) led to greater profits. However, when profit margins

In this paper we look more closely at the range of actants farming, hobby farming, or intensification. These multiple trajectories            enrolled in the establishment of new farming businesses in order to reflect the multiple functions of rural land (e.g. production of food and          demonstrate how the cognitive social practices of new entrants ‘do fuel, environmental protection, and recreation/consumption, Holmes,                work’ in assembling the farm. 2012; Wilson, 2007), with larger holdings typically having greater ‘room for manoevre’ in performing these different functions (Wilson, 2007).              2. New farms as assemblages     Although Cusworth (2020) mentions that younger farmers tend to have more strongly internalised new environmental ‘rules of the game’,                 We develop the good farming concept by integrating assemblage the change processes described in the literature to date largely reflect           thinking with Bourdieu’s conceptualisation of symbolic capital – the alterations to existing, long-held farming symbols (Sutherland and                 most common theoretical underpinning for the good farmer literature Darnhofer, 2012). In this paper we consider how symbols of good                    (Burton et al., 2021).

The particular advantage this paper we pursue this research question through an empirical study             of assemblage thinking is the opportunity to consider that disparate of new entrants to crofting (a legally protected form of smallholding in           entities can hold together, without necessarily forming a coherent whole the United Kingdom).

For the new           heritage embodied in the ‘men at the fank’ - who could pass on tacit entrants in the study, the successive de-territorialisation of crofting              knowledge and the key elements of good crofter identity - were also lost. through low commodity prices and land abandonment opened up                          The assemblage lost one of its most important forces.

Thus, crofting with the erosion of symbols of cultural capital identified by Sutherland             became ripe for re-territorialisation. (2013) and Sutherland and Darnhofer (2012). In seeking to revitalise                     The application of assemblage thinking to crofting has enabled us to their croft holdings, study participants opted to engage in new fields,              disentangle processes of childhood socialisation from the direct which operated under different rules. However, in reflection of the                  engagement with ‘rules of the game’ as adults attempting to establish strong legal and social coding of the term ‘croft’, they sought to justify           and develop a viable croft.

Work on the good farmer recognises the importance based around those commodities.
