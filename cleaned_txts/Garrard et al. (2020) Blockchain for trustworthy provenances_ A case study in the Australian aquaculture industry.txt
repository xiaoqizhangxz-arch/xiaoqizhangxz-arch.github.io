ARTICLE                           INFO                 ABSTRACT
Keywords:                                              We explore the potential for a blockchain ledger to record supply chain provenances in an inherently Blockchain                                             trustworthy manner. The use of blockchain in this setting may allow for traceability of products through the Provenance                                             supply chain without fear that an item’s provenance is fraudulent or has been tampered with. We compare the Traceability                                                        desirable properties of a blockchain ledger to those of a traditional database. We also consider challenges to the Trust                                                        trustworthiness of a provenance idiosyncratic to the context of supply chains. We present a case study in which Aquaculture                                                        we conduct a series of semi-structured interviews with members of the prawn aquaculture industry in Australia.                                                        This industry was chosen as it stands to gain from robust provenances due to international competition. We                                                        find that blockchain based technology is unlikely to deliver substantial gains to the industry when compared                                                        to alternatives. Rather, most gains are likely to arise from the industry becoming digitalized, which would be                                                        a precondition for any blockchain technology to be operational.

For example, a row could be a transaction that takes place in                     narily quickly. The agent wishing to write data to the database connects the supply chain and its columns may include the actor transferring                        to the server and their identity is authenticated. Once the connection an object, the actor receiving it, the type of object being exchanged,                     is open, they may write as much data as they like without having to the payment amount, etc. As a common architecture that is cheap                            be constantly re-authenticated. For each submission an agent wishes to administer, we use this as a point of comparison to blockchains.                        to write to a blockchain, they must use a cryptographic signature to Table 1 provides a summary against a set of desirable characteristics                                                                                            authenticate their identity and may be limited in the amount of data for a database to possess.                                                                                            that may stored in a block.8 The data submitted to the network must be     Decentralization.

Because let’s say we were wanting to interviewer indicates the immediate learning, and an associated change                                                                                          tie into a blockchain system, we can present using information like this... in perception, regarding how useful (or not) blockchain technology                                                                                          but someone else is going to present it in a different way, so how does might be in the prawn aquaculture supply chain:                                                                                          that all link up and make sense at the end, I think that’s going to be the                                                                                          challenge. (4)   Interviewer (I): have you heard of blockchain technology?   (3) I have. I’m starting to get my head around it. I kind of get it...                    Interviewees, while recognizing that they were not experts on   I: Do you think that that could be used somehow?                                      blockchain technology, seemed rather optimistic about the application                                                                                         of blockchain technology in the prawn aquaculture supply chain.   (3) I think it probably could... it would actually be highly suitable to that   blockchain stuff because it wouldn’t be that difficult to implement.                                                                                         4.3. Traceability   I: Do you think farmers or anyone along the supply chain would be   on board with making the history of all of their transactions and every                                                                                             Exploration of existing mechanisms through the supply chain retransaction they make publicly available for anyone in the supply chain                                                                                         vealed that some of the potential benefits of a blockchain technology   to see? Do you think they’d be okay with it?                                                                                         already exist in alternative forms. For example barcoding systems to   (3) It depends what you mean by every transaction. I’d generally say no.              enable traceability of inputs:   I: For example, when a feed supplier sells feed to a farm, when that money   changes hands, that transaction gets listed on a public ledger for anybody             There’s traceability for everything, everything has got batch numbers. For   to basically look up and observe it.                                                   every feed that’s batched there’s a batch number which relates back to all   (3) That’s true isn’t it? So, no, it wouldn’t be their first option, I wouldn’t        the ingredients that have been put in it. They all have batch numbers that   think. But they’re very open with each other and they interact farm to                 link to that batch so we can trace it right back to the supplier. (4)   farm and discuss the operations and all that sort of stuff pretty well, but            So we have a product tracing program so everything’s barcoded and   of course they are competitive.                                                        scanned and stored and the same when it goes out so that when it goes to                                                                                          the customer, everything’s traceable, digitally. (6)    Similar discussions were had with many of the interviewees, with uncertainty regarding the actual implications of such a technology                       Probably that is sufficient, with respect to, you can go right back to the being deployed:                                                                          farm, and you’ve got the day, the batch number and all the records can                                                                                          be available if you need to query something. (3)   The blockchain idea got forwarded to me while I was the R&D [Research   and Development] chair. I must admit I had to Google it... I still don’t                  Along with barcoding, systems were in place (or being developed) to   fully get it but I think I understand the basics. I probably don’t understand         allow relevant members of the supply chain to have visibility regarding   enough to give an intelligent, informed answer but certainly if I understand          inputs, outputs and the product credentials through certification:
                                                                                    6 R. Garrard and S. Fielke                                                                                                             Technology in Society 62 (2020) 101298
  Everything runs through an accounting system, we sell our hatchery feeds                There would be significant improvements in feed quality, both in the hatchthrough our website. We’re looking at the solutions for a customer portal               ery and on the farm. Significant improvements in [the] pond management   essentially. Where people log in and are able to see where it’s at, we’re               side of things. (1)   working on a lot of those kind of things but it’s a slow process. (4)                   We’ve come a long way. . . what I would say though is, it’s still very early   We’re in the final stages of getting what’s called ASC certification, Aqua-             days. If we were to compare ourselves to other industry like pork, chicken,   culture Stewardship Council. It’s the equivalent of the MSC, Marine                     beef. They’re quite mature industries that are effectively at the top end of   Stewardship Council, one for the wild fisheries. So it’s an independent                 their exponential curve in terms of innovation and growth. Even though   international certification program... So they come and do audits on                    we’ve had those advances in the last 20 years we’re certainly at the bottom   the farm. We had three auditors here for five days and they look at                     end of that curve. (6)   environmental and social aspects of the business. . . they go around the   local community, randomly interviewing the local community to ensure                       The following comments indicate that more could be done to monithere’s no issues with the business. [They] interview all the staff to make            tor, track and model prawn production through the supply chain in an   sure there’s no issues there and have to provide an extensive suite of                 effort to automate aspects of growth and movement through the chain:   documents for them to review. There’s a list of standards that they have   to cross check against. They then do a report to the ASC Board, which                   If we can use real-time monitoring to measure eight, nine, different   is based internationally and provide their recommendations against the                  parameters and then have some quite good advanced modelling to interpret   standards and then the Board either gives the certification or it doesn’t               all those data and the trends, I think that can be extremely powerful and   and that’s communicated to us and then we provide that to [the retailer]..              certainly be one of those quantum leaps forward in really understanding   (6)                                                                                     the fine relationships between all the different water body parameters that                                                                                           might be otherwise overlooked through lack of time or from the complexity     Importantly, one interviewee explains transparency through the                        of the data. (5) supply chain, leading to questions of what the added value proposition                    I’d love to be able to have real time access to - I’m just fantasising here of blockchain technology would be:                                                        being able to track a consignment of fresh prawns that have left [prawn                                                                                           farm] this afternoon and being able to know where that is the whole   I mean maybe there’s practical issues but again I’m a big fan of trans-                 way down in real time, that would be just tremendous. Because there’s   parency so the old days of doing business was cloak and dagger and you                  a continual bugbear because when you’re dealing with a product with a   withheld information and you kept that close to your chest because that                 short shelf life, and it’s two to three to five days to a market place, and it’s   generated you your money and there’s still - that’s the old way of doing                only got a 12 day shelf life, or 15 day shelf life nowadays, that would be   business in the seafood industry. But in my opinion, it shouldn’t be that               just tremendous for the customers to be able to look on their mobile phone   way anymore. There’s no reason for it at all. I mean I know what margin                 and go okay, well it hasn’t turned up at 6 am but I know it’s just an hour   the wholesalers is, I know what margins retailers put on their product,                 out of Sydney and it will be here in an hour’s time. (7)   they all know what margins we charge, what commission we charge. We   know what the profitability of the farms are... I’m pretty aware of the                 I guess the next step going forward is to automate and be able to trust   profitability throughout the supply chain, I mean I can tell you what                   those systems that can do the more, I guess the human things like analyse   percentage most people in the supply chain are making and I think there’s               the pond water quality parameters and know what actions to take and   nothing wrong with that. (7)                                                            be able to analyse the relationships of the water quality parameters and                                                                                           prawn health and perhaps more speedy real-time information or predictive    In addition to the possible positive impacts on traceability, in-                      tools about the way prawn health or animal’s health is heading to make creased transparency has the potential to create privacy issues and have                  more speedy decisions. That’s what I think will happen in the next five to implications for taxation:                                                                ten years or ten to 15 years. (5)
  Simply the fact that you have got farms that have got one or two sites or                  There was also recognition that producers would need access to   more and if you have got a public view on all of that, including the ATO               internet connections that were reliable and met the perquisite criteria   [Australian Taxation Office], and the guys go ‘‘I’m delivering it here’’ but           of digital technologies:   I didn’t use it all and then they’re going to take it up here, it will make one   farm look like he’s (sic) made an enormous profit and a loss on the other               I mean communication, the NBN [National Broadband Network] at the   one isn’t going to be connected at all. . . It is still farming and to have that        farm, I mean not that the NBN has really worked that well, but better   sort of visibility I think would be quite dangerous, to be honest, from their           internet back at the producer’s level would be beneficial. The more reliant   point of view. It doesn’t help me and it won’t help [the retailer] because,             we are, it’s sometimes hard for them to keep up. And mobile phone systems   going back to the trust side of it, we all have to trust each other to do               and stuff like that. (7)   the right thing by each other and those that we finally found we couldn’t   really trust in the end, we had to drop. (8)                                           4.5. The existing trust context
4.4. Other priority areas for investment                                                    In describing the prawn aquaculture supply chain, trust was obviously important to interviewees. Importantly, the relationships between     It is important to consider the opportunity cost of any investment                   individuals and organizations at different points of the supply chain in blockchain technology in the prawn aquaculture supply chain. Re-                      were explicitly recognized: sources utilized (time, money, or energy) in initiating or developing blockchain could be used to accomplish other things. To that end,                         I make sure that I’m getting, if it says 98 percent sodium nitrate I make interviewees were asked how important innovation was to them and                          sure that it is 98 percent. So I certainly deal with the bigger companies and what they saw as the most important areas for investment in the                           develop good relationships. Feed is another really important one, I use the prawn aquaculture supply chain in the future. Responses involved                          bigger companies or bigger, highly recognised brands in hatchery feeds... genetic improvement, feed/input improvements, modelling, real-time                        [and] tend to shy back from smaller companies [with less] rigorous quality data, automation and online access improvement. Improvements in                           control. (5) prawn biology were a popular example of an area whereby investment                        But today, I mean, after doing it for nearly 27 years it is really a lot less would improve productivity and minimize risk:                                             effort these days because the guys that we deal with know what they are
                                                                                     7 R. Garrard and S. Fielke                                                                                                           Technology in Society 62 (2020) 101298
  doing, care about what they are doing and there is only a couple of guys               the suppliers untrustworthy but it’s just for some of these specifications the   that have survived that really shave every corner. (8)                                 tools and stuff to test accurately and quickly don’t exist... So you rush   I think trust is critical right along the supply chain... with respect to trust        to do it yourself and that’s when you’ve got to work with a good or a   I know that it does occur and is relevant at each step of the supply chain.            bad supplier, an honest one or a dishonest one and hope that it all works                                                                                          out. So that’s why we check everything because even with a multi-national   It is not so much the direct proof that they need, it’s actually built from                                                                                          company who should be very reliable sometimes there [are] errors. (4)   relationships. (3)   We’re not always privy to what diets our farms are using. We have a rough                Due to the cost in the event of an issue being incurred by the   idea, in relationships with the main companies but that’s not to say that             producers and associated reputational cost of betrayal in such a small   individual farmers don’t get tempted by cheaper prices and go and buy it              industry, it was recognized that in most transactions there was no real   direct from other producers’ off-shore. I suppose we lose visibility on that.         incentive for fraudulent behaviour. Rather, there were incentives to   Freight companies, we often lose visibility in that process between leaving           monitor and track products closely to avoid increased costs:   the farm and getting to the customer. We have direct contacts with the   freight companies but the difference between being delivered at 6 am at                If they [prawn farmers] do a week’s production and have it all under   the Sydney Fish Markets to 8 am is a huge difference. (7)                              one use by date, which would be stupid for a start, and there is an issue                                                                                          then they have got a whole week of product that they are going to have     There was also recognition, however, that the potential abuse of                     to recall, withdraw, credit, whatever, because they didn’t identify it and trust can and does occur. In particular, examples of blatant food fraud                  micro manage it. (8) or product substitution were described:                                                                                          Now, I don’t even really think there’s too much fraud or that stuff going                                                                                          on in Australia because as I said before, there’s only two or three major   We knew that the guys [at a fresh seafood market] were putting ‘Product                                                                                          aquaculture suppliers and they usually deal with the big aquaculture supof Australia’ on stuff that was imported. They have got in December some                                                                                          plier companies that everyone knows or they’re certainly known globally.   extra-large [prawns], and back in those days it was a struggle to get a                                                                                          But, ideally, we have a lot of smaller different players who are competing   large prawn, let alone an extra-large or a jumbo size out. So we knew                                                                                          for a massive market and, you know, Australia is usually quite stringent.   what they had out on display and calling them ‘Australian’ was absolute                                                                                          There’s not - I don’t think there’s too much fraud that happens in the supply   crap. The guys [at a fresh seafood market] were blatantly proud of the                                                                                          chain. (5)   fact they were able to get away with this sort of crap. (8)   I think the [supply chain] thing has become a lot more robust and it’s not                This section has reported results from the perspective of the interthrough monitoring per se, it’s more through the trust relationship.
