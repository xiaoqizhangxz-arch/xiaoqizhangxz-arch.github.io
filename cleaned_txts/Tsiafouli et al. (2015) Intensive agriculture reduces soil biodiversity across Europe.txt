                                                                                                      2 46   Abstract
47          Soil biodiversity plays a key role in regulating the processes that underpin the delivery
48   of ecosystem goods and services in terrestrial ecosystems. Agricultural intensification is
49   known to change the diversity of individual groups of soil biota, but less is known about how
50   intensification affects biodiversity of the soil food web as a whole, and whether or not these
51   effects may be generalized across regions. We examined biodiversity in soil food webs from
52   grasslands, extensive and intensive rotations in four agricultural regions across Europe: in
53   Sweden, the UK, the Czech Republic and Greece. Effects of land use intensity were
54   quantified based on structure and diversity among functional groups in the soil food web, as
55   well as on community-weighted mean body mass of soil fauna. We also elucidate land use
56   intensity effects on diversity of taxonomic units within taxonomic groups of soil fauna. We
57   found that between regions soil food web diversity measures were variable, but that
58   increasing land use intensity caused highly consistent responses. In particular, land use
59   intensification reduced the complexity in the soil food webs, as well as the community60   weighted mean body mass of soil fauna. In all regions across Europe, species richness of
61   earthworms, Collembolans and oribatid mites was negatively affected by increased land use
62   intensity. The taxonomic distinctness, which is a measure of taxonomic relatedness of species
63   in a community that is independent of species richness, was also reduced by land use
64   intensification. We conclude that intensive agriculture reduces soil biodiversity, making soil
65   food webs less diverse and composed of smaller bodied organisms. Land use intensification
66   results in fewer functional groups of soil biota with fewer and taxonomically more closely
67   related species. We discuss how these changes in soil biodiversity due to land use
68   intensification may threaten the functioning of soil in agricultural production systems.
                                                                                                      3 69   Introduction
70          Soil biodiversity plays a key role in regulating processes that underpin the delivery of
71   ecosystem goods and services in terrestrial ecosystems (Barrios, 2007; Eisenhauer et al.,
72   2012; Wall et al., 2012; de Vries et al., 2013, Wagg et. al., 2014). Among the threats to soil
73   biodiversity, land use change due to agricultural intensification and subsequent loss of soil
74   organic matter are considered major drivers (Gardi et al., 2013). Negative effects of intensive
75   agricultural land use on soil biodiversity have been often observed. However, the majority of
76   studies has focused on abundance, species richness, and community structure of single (e.g.
77   Yeates et al., 1999; Sousa et al., 2006; Feijoo et al., 2011) or limited amounts of taxonomic
78   groups of soil biota, or single sites (e.g. Wardle et al., 1999; Postma-Blaauw et al., 2010;
79   Wickings & Grandy, 2013). Alternative approaches have considered soil food webs that
80   aggregate species or taxa to functional groups based on their trophic positions and taxonomy
81   (Moore et al., 1989). Food web approaches can be useful for predicting transfer rates of
82   nutrients, carbon and energy between the trophic positions and through the community (Hunt
83   et al., 1987; de Ruiter et al., 1993), but the metrices that they provide are more indicative of
84   ecosystem processes and functioning, rather than providing information on soil biodiversity.
85   As most studies are either incidental (too few groups) or too general (food web approaches),
86   or focusing on only one or few sites a good perspective on consequences of global land use
87   intensification across a variety of regions is still lacking.
88           The possible consequences of loss of species from food webs due to agricultural
89   intensification have mainly focused on terrestrial above-ground host-parasitoid systems (e.g.
90   Albrecht et al., 2007; Tylianakis et al., 2007; Macfadyen et al., 2009; Lohaus et al., 2013),
91   whereas such knowledge on soil food webs is mainly lacking. Understanding the
92   consequences of agricultural land use on soil biodiversity requires taking into account that
93   biodiversity is a multidimensional concept (Purvis & Hector, 2000). Changes in diversity
                                                                                                        4  94   within one group in the food web can affect diversity of another group through bottom-up or
 95   top down effects (Gessner et al., 2010), thereby affecting food web properties, including food
 96   web structure, diversity or stability (Neutel et al., 2002). Therefore, when analyzing soil
 97   biodiversity responses to land use intensification, various aspects of diversity and ecologically
 98   relevant properties, such as body mass, have to be addressed; both for the entire soil food web
 99   and its components.
100          The aim of the present study was to test how agricultural intensification can impact on
101   soil biodiversity across agricultural regions that vary in a number of aspects, including soil
102   types and climatic conditions. We analyzed effects of agricultural intensification on structure
103   and diversity of almost all components of the soil food webs, on diversity of their components
104   (soil faunal taxonomic groups) and on community-weighted mean body mass of soil fauna in
105   four European regions, represented by southern Sweden, southern UK, western Czech
106   Republic and northern Greece. We have recently shown that land use intensification in these
107   four regions profoundly changes ecosystem processes (de Vries et al., 2013). In the present
108   study, we also examine how general diversity measures, measures that incorporate
109   information about the taxonomic relatedness of species within soil faunal taxonomic groups,
110   and community-weighted mean body mass of soil fauna as an important trait value of the soil
111   biota are influenced by increased land use intensity. The latter diversity measures have not yet
112   been explored in soil communities, but can offer a way to measure complementary aspects of
113   species diversity (Gascón et al., 2009), which could indicate functionally important aspects of
114   community composition (Srivastava et al., 2012).
115          We considered 19 different functional groups of the soil food web, namely bacteria,
116   saprophytic fungi, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, amoebae, flagellates, enchytraeids,
117   earthworms, Collembolans (bacterivorous, fungivorous, phytophagous, omnivorous and
118   predaceous), mites (fungivorous and predaceous), as well as nematodes (bacterivorous,
                                                                                                        5 119   fungivorous, plant associated, plant parasitic and omnivorous/predaceous). Specifically, we
120   quantified effects of agricultural land use intensity on the average trophic level and the
121   diversity among functional groups in the soil food web, as well as on the diversity within four
122   soil faunal taxonomic groups (earthworms, oribatid mites, Collembolans and nematodes). In
123   addition, we determined whether changes in diversity among functional groups may be related
124   to changes in diversity within soil faunal taxonomic groups. Finally, we established land use
125   intensification effects on community-weighted mean body mass of soil fauna, as this is an
126   important trait value of the soil biota.
                                                                                                      6 127   Material and methods
128   Field sites, soil sampling and analysis
129      We collected soil samples from farms in southern Sweden (region Scania: SE), southern
130   UK (region Chilterns: UK), western Czech Republic (region České Budějovice: CZ) and
131   northern Greece (region Kria Brisi: GR). The regions and farms were chosen to represent
132   replicating agricultural management types across Europe, irrespective of soil types and
133   climate. The annual mean/min/max temperature at the different sites are: 7.8/6.6/9.6 °C (SE),
134   9.5/5.5/13.5 °C (UK), 7.9/3/13 °C (CZ) and 14/4/31 °C (GR). The annual precipitation is 666
135   mm, 625 mm, 700 mm and 435 mm respectively. The dominant soil types are Calcaric
136   Cambisol (SE), Chromic Luvisol, Leptosol (UK), Stagnic Luvisol, Dystric Cambisol (CZ),
137   and Fluvisol (GR).
138      Soil samples were collected at two occasions: autumn-winter 2008 and spring-summer
139   2009. The precise date of sampling differed between countries to ensure similar phenological
140   status of the growing crop, i.e: SE and UK: November 2008, June 2009, GR: December 2008,
141   April 2009, CZ: November 2008, May 2009. At each sampling occasion, in each region
142   sampling was done at five farms, each including three management types. The management
143   types were: low intensity (grasslands (G)); medium intensity (extensive rotations (E), where a
144   legume or grass is present in a 5 year rotation and kept for at least a year - tilled at most every
145   two years); and high intensity (intensive rotation (I) with annual crops and winter wheat at the
146   time of sampling - annually tilled). This nested design resulted in 60 sampling sites (4 regions
147   × 5 farms × 3 management types). In each site (i.e. field), two plots of 1 m2 each were
148   randomly selected for sampling but were at least 15 m away from the edge of the field and
149   separated from each other by at least 50 m. Duplicate samples (i.e from the same sampling
150   site) were analyzed separately but data were averaged prior to statistical analyses. Additional
                                                                                                        7 151   details on climate, soil properties and management of sites are given in de Vries et al. (2013)
152   (see SI, Tables S4-S7).
153      For earthworms soil monoliths of 25 x 25 cm length x width and 10 cm depth were taken
154   from each plot. Earthworms were hand sorted, preserved in 5% formalin in the field and
155   transferred after 24h to 70 % ethanol. Earthworms were counted, weighed and determined to
156   species level using keys of Sims & Gerard (1985), Mršic (1991) and Pižl (2002). For
157   microorganisms, mesofauna, nematodes, protozoa and enchytraeids 1-3 replicate cores were
158   taken of 3-5cm diameter and 10cm depth. Replicate cores were but together to form one
159   composite sample per plot for each group. Samples were kept cool at 4oC until analysis or
160   extraction. Specific PLFAs were used as markers of bacterial and saprophytic fungal biomass
161   (Frostegård & Bååth, 1996), and NLFAs for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AM) biomass
162   (Olsson et al., 1995). Fatty acids were converted to biomass carbon (C) using the following
163   factors: bacterial biomass 363.6 nmol PLFA = 1 mg carbon (Frostegård & Bååth, 1996),
164   fungal biomass: 11.8 nmol PLFA = 1 mg carbon (Klamer & Bååth, 2004), and AMF biomass:
165   1.047 nmol NLFA = 1 μg carbon (Olsson et al., 1995).
166      Soil mesofauna were extracted from undisturbed samples using Tullgren funnels.
167   Collembolans were determined to species level using keys of Gisin (1960), Babenko et al.
168   (1994), and Zimbars & Dunger (1994). Mites were sorted to suborders using Krantz & Walter
169   (2009), and oribatid mites were determined to species level using keys of Balogh & Mahunka
170   (1983) and Weigman (2006). Biomass of mesofauna was estimated from body dimensions
171   after Lebrun (1971). Nematodes were extracted using the modified Cobb sieving and
172   decanting method (s’Jacob & Van Bezooijen, 1984), counted and fixed in 4% formaldehyde.
173   150 randomly chosen individuals were identified to genus level according to Bongers (1994)
174   and allocated to trophic groups following Yeates et al. (1993). Nematode biomass was
175   estimated individually by analyzing digital microscope images with a specially developed
                                                                                                        8 176   software tool by Sgardelis et al. (2009). Protozoa numbers were estimated using a modified
177   most probable number method (Rønn et al., 1995).
178      Biomass was estimated based on assumptions about average body size (biovolumes of
179   flagellates and amoeba: 50 µm3, and 400 µm3 respectively) and dry weight (for both 0.2 pg
180   µm-3), following Ekelund et al. (2001). Enchytraeids were extracted from intact soil core
181   samples using wet funnels according to O’Connor (1962), and their biomass was estimated
182   according to Makulec (1983). Biomass of soil animals was converted to C (carbon content
183   estimated to 50% of dry mass). Community- weighted mean of body mass was calculated as
184   CBM = Bfa Afa -1, where Bfa is the total biomass and Afa is the total abundance of all soil faunal
185   groups in the sample (bacteria, fungi and AM fungi are not included in the calculation).
186   Measures of structure and diversity of soil food webs
187      Soil biota were allocated to 19 different functional groups, namely bacteria, saprophytic
188   fungi, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, amoebae, flagellates, enchytraeids, earthworms,
189   bacterivorous Collembolans, fungivorous Collembolans, phytophagous Collembolans,
190   omnivorous Collembolans, predaceous Collembolans, fungivorous (oribatid) mites,
191   predaceous mites, bacterivorous nematodes, fungivorous nematodes, plant associated (root
192   hair feeding) nematodes, plant parasitic nematodes, and omnivorous/predaceous nematodes.
193   Biomass of all functional groups was expressed as kg C per m2 using the appropriate bulk
194   density values. Carbon flows between functional groups in the food web were estimated in
195   order to build quantitative food webs based on trophic position following Hunt et al. (1987)
196   and de Ruiter et al. (1995). The trophic position of functional groups in the food web is
197   defined by the average of the trophic position of the functional group it consumes weighted by
                                                                         𝑁                                                                          𝑓𝑤 198   the diet fraction this functional group represents as: 𝑇𝐿𝑖 = 1 + ∑𝑗=1 𝑔𝑖𝑗 𝑇𝐿𝑗 where TLi is the
199   trophic level of functional group i and gij the fraction of the consumer group i’s diet derived
200   from the prey group j and Nfw is the number of groups in the food web. These “flow-based”                                                                                                         9 201   trophic levels are computed following the method of Levine (1980) and Williams & Martinez
202   (2004). The column vector TL defined as 𝑇𝐿 = ((𝐼 − 𝐺)−1 )𝑇 𝟣 gives the trophic level of each
203   consumer with I the identity matrix (with dimension 𝑁𝑓𝑤 × 𝑁𝑓𝑤 ) and G = (gij) with
204   dimension 𝑁𝑓𝑤 × 𝑁𝑓𝑤 and 𝟣 a vector filled with ones (with dimension 𝑁𝑓𝑤 × 1). Values for
205   the coefficients of feeding preferences used are given in de Vries et al. (2013).
206      In the analyses, the following measures describing structure and diversity of the entire food
207                                                  ̅̅̅̅) calculated as average of all values of group       web were calculated: i) average trophic level (𝑇𝐿
                                                  1 208                                    ̅̅̅̅ =       trophic level in the food web as 𝑇𝐿              (𝑇𝐿)𝑇 𝟣; ii) richness, expressed as the number of                                               𝑁   𝑓𝑤
209   functional groups in the food web (Nfw); and iii) Shannon index (FH) calculated as 𝐹𝐻 =                      𝐵𝑖        𝑁𝑓𝑤 𝐵𝑖 − 𝐵𝑡𝑜𝑡 210   ∏𝑖=1 (𝐵 )      with Bi the biomass of the functional group i and Btot the total food web              𝑡𝑜𝑡
211   biomass.
212   Measures of diversity within soil faunal taxonomic groups
213         For the four key soil faunal taxonomic groups (earthworms, Collembolans, oribatid
214   mites and nematodes) that comprise in total 12 functional groups in the food web we
215   considered both commonly used diversity measures, such as richness and Shannon index, as
216   well as measures that incorporate information about the taxonomic relatedness of species,
217   such as average taxonomic distinctness and breadth (for definition see below). These
218   measures were based on abundance data of species or genera in the taxonomic groups and
219   were independent from the measures concerning the entire soil food web that were based on
220   functional group biomass data.
221         The following diversity measures were estimated: i) Richness (N) as number (ln
222   transformed) of species of earthworms (NE), Collembolans (NC), oribatid mites (NO) and
223   genera of nematodes (NN); ii) Shannon index (H) for earthworms (HE), Collembolans (HC),
224   oribatid mites (HO) and nematodes (HN), iii) average taxonomic distinctness (Δ*) for                                                                                                        10 225   earthworms (Δ*Ε), Collembolans (Δ*C), oribatid mites (Δ*O) and nematodes (Δ*N), and iv)
226   average taxonomic breadth (Δ+) for earthworms (Δ+Ε), Collembolans (Δ+C), oribatid mites
227   (Δ+O) and nematodes (Δ+N). For the nematode taxonomic group, which includes five
228   abundantly represented functional groups, the four diversity measures were estimated also for
229   each group separately.
230          Average taxonomic distinctness (Δ*) was calculated according to Warwick & Clarke
                                                                            [∑∑𝑖<𝑗 𝜔𝑖𝑗 𝑥𝑖 𝑥𝑗 ] 231   (1995) between all species/genera in a community at each sample as:                        where ωij                                                                               [∑∑𝑖<𝑗 𝑥𝑖 𝑥𝑗 ]
232   is the path length between the two species i and j that show the greatest taxonomic
233   (phylogenetic) distance between them in a Linnaean classification tree including all species of
234   a community and a maximum distance set to 100, and xi and xj are the number of individuals
235   of species i and j, respectively. This index provides an estimate of the expected taxonomic
236   distance between two randomly chosen individuals from a sample and is independent of
237   sample size (Clarke & Warwick, 2001). Average taxonomic breadth (Δ+) was computed
238   analogously to the average taxonomic distinctness, but is based on presence/absence, instead
239   of abundance data for species and therefore provides the average taxonomic distance between
240   all pairs of species in a community. Communities with several closely related species can be
241   considered less diverse than communities with the same number, but with more distantly
242   related species (Clarke & Warwick, 1998) as diversity is measured in terms of features
243   accumulated over evolutionary history (Schweiger et al., 2008). Taxonomic trees were built
244   according to information about suborder, family, genus and species level for Collembolans;
245   superfamily, family, genus and species level for Oribatida; class, order, superfamily, family
246   and genus level for Nematoda; and family, genus and species level for earthworms. All
247   taxonomic information was derived from the Fauna Europaea Database (de Jong, 2013).
248   Statistical analysis
                                                                                                       11 249          We used permutational analyses of variance to evaluate the effects of land use
250   intensity in the different regions while accounting for sampling season during these analyses
251   (PERMANOVA; Anderson, 2005) with log(x+1) transformed data for the analysis. Data were
252   transformed to weight down the effect of numerically dominant taxa in analyses. All
253   PERMANOVA analyses were performed with region (SE, UK, CZ, GR) as fixed factor, land
254   use intensity levels (G, E, I,) nested within region and sampling season (autumn-winter 2008,
255   spring-summer 2009) nested within the factors region and land use intensity. The distance
256   measure to generate dissimilarity matrices for data was the deviance of dissimilarities, and
257   4999 permutations were used in all cases. Pair-wise a posteriori tests were performed among
258   levels of factor: a) “region”, b) “land use intensity” within factor “region” and c) “sampling
259   season” within factor “land use intensity” within factor “region”. We used the Fortran
260   software PERMANOVA (Anderson, 2005) for these analyses.
261          The following sets of variables were analyzed with PERMANOVA: i) Measures
262   describing the entire food web: Nfw, FH, and ̅𝑇𝐿                                                     ̅̅̅; ii) Richness within the four soil faunal
263   taxonomic groups: NE, NC, NO and NN; iii) Shannon index within the four soil faunal taxonomic
264   groups: HE, HC, HO and HN; iv) average taxonomic distinctness within the four soil faunal
265   taxonomic groups: Δ*Ε, Δ*C, Δ*O and Δ*N; and v) average taxonomic breadth within the four
266   soil faunal taxonomic groups: Δ+Ε, Δ+C, Δ+O and Δ+N. In addition, permutational univariate
267   analyses of variance were used for each of the individual response variables mentioned and
268   furthermore, for the community- weighted mean body mass of soil fauna (CBM) and for the
269   four measures concerning diversity within the five nematode functional groups separately.
270          Pearson correlation tests were used for simple bivariate testing of relationships
271   between measures regarding diversity within the four soil faunal taxonomic groups and
272   measures regarding diversity among functional groups in the soil food web. For this analysis
273   we used the SPSS v19 software package.
                                                                                                       12 274   Results
275   Land use intensity influence on structure and diversity among functional groups
276   in the soil food web
277      The overall diversity and structure of soil food webs differed significantly with land use
278   intensity and region after statistically accounting for seasonal effects (Table 1). This overall
279   effect (multivariate) was primarily a result of the significant differences between intensive
280   rotations (I) and grasslands (G). These differences were unanimous for all regions. The
281   extensive rotations (E) were more variable and were not different from intensive rotations and
282   grasslands in SE, UK and GR, and from grasslands in CZ (for pair-wise a posteriori
283   comparisons see Table 1).
284      Land use intensity significantly affected all the individual measures of food web diversity
285   and structure, i.e. the number of functional groups (Nfw), Shannon index (FH), and the average
286                  ̅̅̅̅) (permutational univariate analysis of variance, Fig. 1). In each region, at       trophic level (𝑇𝐿
287   least one of these variables had a significantly higher value in grassland compared to intensive
288   rotation. This indicates that soil food webs are less complex in soils from intensive rotations
289   than in soil from grasslands. The number of functional groups, the Shannon index and the
290   average trophic level in the soil food web varied significantly among regions (Fig. 1). The
291   average trophic level was higher in soil food webs from CZ compared to the other regions,
292   while the Shannon index was higher in food webs from SE. This can be explained by the total
293   biomass of almost all functional groups in the food webs that varied accordingly among the
294   regions.
295   Land use intensity influence on community-weighted mean body mass of soil
296   fauna
                                                                                                         13 297      Land use intensity significantly affected the community-weighted mean body mass of soil
298   fauna (CBM) (permutational univariate analysis of variance, Fig. 2). In all regions except UK
299   the CBM was significantly lower in the intensive rotation compared to the grassland. This
300   indicates that soil animals under intensive rotation are generally smaller; larger animals
301   appear more prone to be reduced by land use intensification.
302   Land use intensity and diversity within soil faunal taxonomic groups
303      Across all sites, we identified a total of 20 earthworm, 72 Collembolan and 48 oribatid
304   mite species, as well as 75 nematode genera. All four sets of diversity measures of faunal
305   taxonomic groups differed significantly among land use intensities and regions when
306   accounting for seasonal effects (Table 2). These overall effects (multivariate) resulted mainly
307   from the significant differences between intensive rotations and grasslands of all diversity
308   measures in all regions, except for average taxonomic distinctness and breadth in CZ and UK.
309   The diversity within faunal taxonomic groups in extensive rotations did not differ from the
310   intensive rotations or the grasslands, depending on region (for pair-wise a posteriori
311   comparisons see Table 2).
312      In most faunal groups the measures Richness (Ν), Shannon index (H), average taxonomic
313   distinctness (Δ*) and breadth (Δ+) showed lower levels of diversity with increasing agricultural
314   intensity (permutational univariate analysis of variance, Fig. 3,4). Earthworm communities in
315   SE and GR, and Collembolan and oribatid mite communities in all regions except in CZ had
316   fewer numbers of species in the intensively managed fields compared to grasslands and those
317   species were also taxonomically more closely related to each other. In contrast, the diversity
318   of the nematode community was not negatively affected by land use intensity, and in some
319   regions the Shannon index was higher in fields with intensive rotation than those with
320   extensive rotation. The diversity of the nematode functional groups (bacterivorous,
321   fungivorous, plant associated and omnivorous/predaceous) was not significantly affected by
                                                                                                     14 322   increasing agricultural intensity (P>0.05 in all cases). Occasionally, the diversity of plant
323   parasitic nematodes was negatively affected by increasing management intensity, as was
324   observed for richness in CZ and SE (P<0.0008), Shannon index in CZ and UK (P<0.001),
325   average taxonomic distinctness in CZ (P<0.0266) and average taxonomic breadth in CZ and
326   UK (P<0.0234).
327      Several measures of diversity within the taxonomic groups differed significantly between
328   regions (Table 2). Earthworm diversity was lower in GR than in SE. Collembolan diversity
329   was generally higher in CZ than in the other regions and oribatid mite diversity was higher in
330   GR and CZ then in SE and UK (Fig. 3,4).
331   Relationships between diversity among functional groups in the soil food web
332   and diversity within soil faunal taxonomic groups
333      The diversity measures within soil faunal groups were significantly correlated to those
334   among functional groups (Table 3), suggesting that agricultural intensification consistently
335   affects most soil food web components and reduces soil biodiversity. More specifically, the
336   diversity measures for earthworms, Collembolans and oribatid mites, as well as average
337   taxonomic breadth of nematodes, were significantly and positively correlated to the number of
338   functional groups in the food web (Nfw). Earthworm diversity measures also showed a
339   significant positive correlation to the Shannon index (FH) of the functional groups in the food
340   web (Table 3).
                                                                                                      15 341   Discussion
342          In this study, we show that agricultural intensification affects various aspects of
343   diversity in a consistent negative way in four agricultural regions across Europe with
344   contrasting soil and climatic conditions. Specifically, increasing land use intensity decreases
345   diversity within soil faunal taxonomic groups, diversity among functional groups, as well as
346   the average trophic level in the soil food web. The reductions of diversity at the soil food web
347   level were due to a decrease in biomass of functional groups with larger body sizes, especially
348   earthworms, enchytraeids, Collembolans, and oribatid mites, or a decrease in biomass of
349   groups at higher trophic levels, especially predaceous mites, as reported in de Vries et al.
350   (2013). As a result, the community- weighted mean body mass of soil fauna was significantly
351   decreased by land use intensification. Hence at high land use intensity food webs contain
352   fewer trophic levels and fewer species with large body mass.
353          The effect of land use was so intense that in some cases, one or more functional
354   groups were entirely missing. In Greece, for example, earthworms and predaceous
355   Collembolans were absent from intensive rotations, whereas in Sweden, fungivorous mites
356   and predaceous Collembolans were missing. These groups of organisms are characterized by
357   relatively low growth rates and are known to be sensitive to disturbance, with populations
358   often needing decades to recover after tillage (Siepel, 1996; Adl. et al., 2006; Maraun &
359   Scheu, 2000). The presence of a functional group can be related to certain functions, as e.g.
360   earthworms are related to processes of C and N cycling (de Vries et al., 2013), and its
361   biomass is indicative of the magnitude of those functions (sensu Hughes & Roughgarden,
362   2000; Thébault & Loreau, 2006; Berg & Bengtsson, 2007). Hence, the loss or decrease in
363   biomass of these functional groups from the soil food webs will likely result in a long-term
364   reduction of soil functioning in intensive agricultural production systems.
                                                                                                      16 365          Our study shows that changes in the biomass of functional or taxonomic groups are
366   accompanied by changes in their diversity and that they occur across latitudinal positions and
367   soil types as sampled within Europe. The biomass of e.g. earthworms, Collembolans, and
368   oribatid mites were significantly reduced by agricultural intensification (de Vries et al. 2013)
369   as also the diversity, which confirms other case-specific studies (e.g. Pižl, 1999; Caruso et al.,
370   2007; Smith et al., 2008; Dahms et al., 2010). Our data also point out that a decrease in
371   diversity within faunal taxonomic groups was related to a decrease in diversity among
372   functional groups. This indicates that agricultural intensification has a consistent negative
373   effect across most soil food web components and is not limited to specific groups of soil
374   biota, such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Helgason et al., 1998). Agricultural
375   intensification not only reduced richness and Shannon index of faunal groups, but also the
376   average taxonomic distinctness and average taxonomic breadth, which means that the loss of
377   species was consistently related to the loss of taxonomically more distantly related species.
378   Thus, agricultural intensification also caused a loss of taxonomic diversity, which is known to
379   relate positively to functioning (Heemsbergen et al., 2004).
380          It has been argued that functional redundancy in soil communities can be high, due to
381   generalized feeding habits among most soil biota (Setälä et al., 2005). An explanation for the
382   perceived low degree of specificity can be that our tools to detect specialized interactions
383   between cryptic species have been too coarse. With tools to resolve genetic patterns in
384   organisms, specialized trophic interactions are more common than previously thought
385   (Jørgensen et al., 2005, Jørgensen & Hedlund, 2013). Here, we have focused on the trophic
386   role of species, e.g. fungivorous Collembolans, ignoring that two species may both feed on
387   fungi but that their preference for fungal species can differ. Functional differentiation may
388   play an important role in determining how a functional group actually performs, and in the
389   absence of functionally similar species in the community, one species may have a crucial role
                                                                                                      17 390   in affecting a particular ecosystem process (Wardle, 1999) especially in soil ecosystems with
391   low diversity (Barrett et al., 2008). Specific functions such as burrowing by anecic and
392   endogeic earthworms can have substantial effects on soil structure, as these species are
393   sensitive to intensified land management (Gormsen et al., 2004). In Sweden and Greece,
394   intensive rotations had on average only two earthworm species less than grasslands. However
395   the average taxonomic distinctness was significantly reduced in these regions, which may be
396   expected to have important implications for functioning. Given that average taxonomic
397   distinctness serves as a valid proxy for functional differentiation in the community (Gascón et
398   al., 2009; Birkhofer et al., 2014), and that earthworms play an important role in C and N
399   cycling (Lubbers et al., 2013), this decrease in taxonomic differentiation can significantly
400   affect the outcome or the rates of these processes. The declined diversity may reduce
401   ecosystem processes, but previous modeling work using the same dataset has shown that
402   different ecosystem processes relate to loss of specific (or combinations of) species groups
403   (De Vries et al., 2013), which shows that care should be taken with generalizations as that soil
404   biodiversity loss would mean general loss of ecosystem functions.
405           Our results confirm other studies showing that soil animals with larger body sizes,
406   such as earthworms and predaceous Collembolans and mites, are sensitive to intensive
407   agriculture (Mulder et al., 2005; Smith et al., 2008; Postma-Blaauw et al., 2010). Oribatid
408   mites that mainly feed on fungi (e.g. Maraun et al., 1998) and have relatively small size, may
409   suffer from disturbance associated with increasing intensity of agricultural management as
410   well (Sgardelis & Usher, 1994). A decline of diversity within soil faunal groups due to
411   intensive land use is most probably related to frequent tillage, which affects soil physical
412   properties (Roger-Estrade et al., 2010) to the disadvantage of many soil organisms (van
413   Capelle et al., 2012). Tillage alters soil microhabitats and interrupts life cycles, and it is
414   expected that organisms with relatively long life spans are particularly sensitive, such as
                                                                                                       18 415   Collembolans (e.g. Brennan et al., 2006), oribatid mites (e.g. Franchini & Rockett, 1996) and
416   earthworms (e.g. Eriksen-Hamel et al., 2009). In the sites under extensive rotations, less
417   frequent tillage promoted diversity of soil faunal groups such as oribatid mites in Sweden,
418   earthworms in Czech Republic and Greece, and Collembolans in Sweden and Greece.
419          While most soil diversity measures were consistently and negatively affected by
420   intensive agriculture for three faunal groups, diversity of the nematode taxonomic group and
421   the nematode functional groups was hardly affected. This also applies to the biomass of the
422   various nematode functional groups (de Vries et al., 2013). Microbivorous nematodes, are
423   reported to be affected by intensively managed systems (Tsiafouli et al., 2006, Birkhofer et
424   al., 2012), while other studies find no evidence for this (Sánchez-Moreno et al., 2011). This
425   suggests that these nematodes might be affected by specific agricultural practices such as
426   tillage, fertilization, pesticide application, or the application of organic amendments (Tsiafouli
427   et al., 2007, Zhao & Neher 2013), rather than by land use intensity in general. Omnivorous
428   and predaceous nematodes are generally considered sensitive to disturbance (Bongers &
429   Ferris, 1999). Their persistence under increasing land use intensity could be explained by
430   either the higher availability of prey, since other predaceous groups are declining, or by an
431   increase of suitable food resources for omnivorous species (Postma-Blaauw et al., 2010; Mills
432   & Adl, 2011). In any case our data show that when the diversity of other taxonomic groups
433   are depleted under intensive agriculture the functional role of nematodes becomes more
434   important.
435          We conclude that the negative effect of intensive agriculture on soil biodiversity was
436   consistent across regions with widely contrasting climate and soil conditions. Overall,
437   agricultural intensification from grassland to extensive and intensive rotation appears to
438   systematically simplify soil food web diversity, with potential consequences for functioning.
439   The community-weighted mean body mass of soil fauna, the average trophic level and
                                                                                                      19 440   diversity among functional groups in the food web decreased, while some functional groups
441   were lost entirely under intensive land use. Furthermore, soil faunal communities had fewer
442   and taxonomically more closely related species, which suggests that agricultural
443   intensification can threaten the divergent functions that may be provided by taxonomically
444   distant species. Given that the loss of soil biodiversity is ultimately linked to a loss of soil
445   functions that underpin ecosystem services (de Vries et al., 2013; Wagg et al., 2014), we
446   propose that future agricultural policies need to consider how to halt and/or reverse this loss
447   of soil biodiversity. Our finding that the relationship between management regimes and soil
448   biota is fairly stable across regions supports the notion that land use intensification may lead
449   to the same responses of soil biodiversity at continental scales. Future studies need to be
450   targeted at promoting and evaluating innovative management practices for conserving and/or
451   increasing soil biodiversity and the functioning of soil while maintaining sufficient levels of
452   agricultural production.
