However, to date, there has been limited Agency Support networks                                                              attention to assembling PA from the perspective of farmers, what Legun and Burch (2021) refer to as ‘deliberative Digital agriculture                                          assembling’. This paper contributes to knowledge in this area by applying post actor network theoretical work to Agriculture 4.0                                              investigate across case studies in Australia, the Netherlands and France, the forms of tinkering by which farmers                                                              attempt to make PA workable, and what these engender for farmer agency. Through our analysis, we show that                                                              much of the tinkering by farmers is aimed at holding together their own priorities, routines, and experiences with                                                              practices inscribed in PA technology, such as dependence on commercial advice, data-driven knowledge, and                                                              commitment to a single technological platform/company. Integral to this tinkering work are support networks                                                              that include agronomists, advisors, machinery dealers and/or farmer discussion groups. We argue that whilst                                                              these support networks are critical to holding together different practices, and making PA workable, they also                                                              play a more diverse and nuanced role in PA implementation than what has previously been recognised. Our case                                                              studies provide insights into three key forms of tinkering used by farmers in navigating support networks to make                                                              PA workable – disconnection, experimentation and trial-and-error, and trade-offs and compromises – and the                                                              specific distributions of agency which these tinkering practices engender. In conclusion, we argue that a                                                              tinkering lens provides a valuable approach for enabling agri-food scholars to tease out in greater depth delib­                                                              erative assembling practices and how these variously open-up or foreclose options for farmers in making PA                                                              workable.
Introduction                                                                                     2016; Forney, 2021; Forney and Dwiartama, 2022; Jones et al., 2019;                                                                                                     Konefal et al., 2022; Sutherland et al., 2023; Sutherland and Calo, 2020).    Assemblage thinking is becoming an increasingly important                                        Part of the broader ‘relational turn’ in agri-food studies, which dates approach in critical research on food and farming (Dwiartama et al.,                                back to the late-1990s, assemblage thinking is consistent with a

Second, the application of assemblage thinking to PA, assembling from the perspective of farmers (Klerkx et al., 2019), and               and food and farming more broadly, has tended to focus primarily on specifically the work of farmers in ‘assembling and reassembling                    examples within, or from the entry point of, a single country, such as the socio-material practices that are diffuse, tangled and contingent’                  United States (Comi, 2020), United Kingdom (Jones et al., 2019) or (McFarlane, 2009, p. 562).

We expand this     Sutherland and Calo (2020) provide a useful starting point in                   focus by drawing upon case studies of PA implementation across three examining assembling from the perspective of farmers.

The work of            focus on the heterogeneous and experimental, yet also patterned, Sutherland and Calo (2020) and Legun and Burch (2021) is important in               practices through which diverse socio-material relations are held highlighting the creativity, flexibility, and active agency in how farmers          together (Singleton and Law, 2013). Where tinkering builds on these assemble their farms. For example, Sutherland and Calo (2020, p. 541)               concepts is in its explicit emphasis on the deliberative work of human point to how crofters ‘were creative in their mobilisation of new                   actors in making new practices or technologies workable in the context networks and opportunities for their crofts’, while Legun and Burch                 of ‘existing knowledge-practices and farming goals’ (Higgins et al., (2021, p. 389) identify a large number of growers in their research                 2017, p. 200). Significantly, tinkering is also conceptualised as care-ful ‘exhibiting deliberative assembling tendencies’ who ‘were industrious in            work (Mol et al., 2010; Singleton and Law, 2013) in that it is oriented how they navigated complex institutional, political and ecological                  towards farmers engaging with practices and priorities beyond what terrains in order to map their own trajectories’.                                   they care for intrinsically or immediately, also what have been called     In this paper, we build on these deliberative conceptualisations of             ‘non-local cares’ (which vary from farmer to farmer).

We argue that Law’s work on for social scientists interested in the future of food and agriculture (e.g.,       ’care as choreography’ is particularly useful for agri-food scholars in Eastwood et al., 2017; Gardezi and Stock, 2021; Klerkx et al., 2019).
