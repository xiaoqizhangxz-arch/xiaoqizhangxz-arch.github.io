Introduction                                                                                   rural-urban interface, instead of city-centred socio-spatial trans­                                                                                                   formations (Gillen et al., 2022; Qian et al., 2025).

To counter the teleological assumptions of a wholly                           rural and urban areas exhibit increasingly interconnected relationships urbanised planet, scholars have advocated reconceptualising rurality                              and material, discursive, and metabolic exchanges at a planetary scale, from the lens of planetary thinking and rural-urban relationality.

It is argued that                              these rural-urban networks. rurality is not residual but an indispensable part of the planetary system,                           While planetary perspectives have undoubtedly enriched un­ and that the sustainable development of the rural is of planetary sig­                            derstandings of rurality, we contend that a synthesis of these theoretical nificance (He and Zhang, 2022; Wang et al., 2023).

This predisposition is perhaps attributed to an ingrained and                 elimination through industrialisation and urbanisation under ‘state pervasive inclination – shared by scholars, policymakers, practitioners              entrepreneurialism’ (Wu, 2020; Zhang and Wu, 2022) (1980s-2012; see (such as architects and artists), and rural gentrifiers – to engage in rural         Section 5), and finally to an ‘upgraded and romanticised rurality’ within nostalgia, and to seek out rural authenticity and a pastoral ideal (Chen             state-engineered rural eco-modernisation and nostalgic cultural imagi­ et al., 2023; Yang and Xu, 2022).
