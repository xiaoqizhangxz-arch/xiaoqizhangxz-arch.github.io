Yet while it is important to     recognise the collective significance of diverse relational lifeways, practices, and philoso­     phies to transformations, it is also vital to recognise their differences: efforts to produce     universal frameworks and toolboxes for applying relationality can reproduce modernistcolonialist knowledge practices, hinder recognition of the significance of relational     approaches, and marginalise more radical approaches. In this paper we explore five inter­     secting ‘relationalities’ currently contributing to discussions around transformations: (i)     Indigenous-kinship, (ii) systemic-analytical, (iii) posthumanist-performative, (iv) structuralmetabolic, and (v) Latin American-postdevelopment. We explore how these different rela­     tional approaches address key concepts in transformations research, including humannature connectedness; agency and leadership; scale and scaling; time and change; and     knowledge and action. We suggest that their diversity gives rise to practices of transforma­     tions as ‘walking together in a world of many worlds’ and support intercultural dialogue on     sustainability transformations.
    KEY POLICY HIGHLIGHTS     ● Transformations to sustainability require alternatives to the paradigms and policies that       have generated social-ecological destruction and the Anthropocene.     ● Diverse relational approaches to transformations have been articulated by Indigenous,       humanities and social sciences scholars, practitioners, and activists from Global South       and North.     ● Efforts to apply such approaches through universal frameworks or toolboxes may miss the       significance of relational approaches, which are often defined by their attentiveness to       unfolding relations among particular places, peoples, and ecologies.     ● A relevant concept for engaging diverse relational approaches to transformations may be       that of the uncommons – interests in common which are not the same interests.     ● Relational approaches suggest practices of sustainability transformations as ‘walking       together in a world of many worlds’.

This has been coupled with a shift away from            ing some of the diverse relational approaches that are advancing universal theoretical frameworks towards             currently informing transformations research and recognising sustainability transformations as ‘shared          practice, focusing on transformations in relation to spaces’ or matters of care and concern (Pereira et al.         ecosystem management and governance.
