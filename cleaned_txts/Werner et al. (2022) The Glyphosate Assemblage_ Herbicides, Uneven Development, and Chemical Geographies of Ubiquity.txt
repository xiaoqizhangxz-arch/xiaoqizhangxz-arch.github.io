This article           develops a dialogue between agrarian political economy, critical commodity chains research, and chemical           geographies through a case study of the world’s most widely used agrochemical: glyphosate, commonly           known as Monsanto’s Roundup. In the 1980s, glyphosate triumphed as a benign biocide that promised both           safety and effectiveness. This construct made possible a capitalist agricultural assemblage characterized by           chemical pervasiveness, first as a chemical replacement for mechanical tillage and since the 1990s as the           chemical input for genetically modified seed packages. The ubiquity that characterizes the glyphosate           assemblage is also a geography of uneven development comprising shifting firm networks, policies, and trade.           Central to this assemblage since 2000, yet largely ignored, is the outsized expansion of second- and third-tier           generic pesticide producers, especially in China, for whom glyphosate is part of a network entry and           upgrading development strategy. Today, the glyphosate assemblage faces unprecedented challenges from weed           resistance and health controversies. Whether and how the herbicide assemblage restabilizes will be           determined by the complex environmental and developmental challenges of chemical agriculture and           pervasive chemicals broadly, which highlights the need for a transdisciplinary dialogue that cuts across these           domains. Key Words: assemblages, generic herbicides, health, south–south production networks, weed resistance.
