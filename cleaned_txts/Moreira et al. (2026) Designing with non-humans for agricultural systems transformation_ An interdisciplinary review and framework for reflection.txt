Responding to this challenge, agricultural system design scholars have moved Participatory design                                          beyond a focus on merely increasing productivity, supply, and profitability, to include goals such as animal More-than-human                                               welfare and ecological health.

METHODS: A critical review of the state-of-the-art of non-human participation in agricultural systems design                                                  research was done. This was followed by a narrative review, consulting several approaches from critical social                                                  sciences, such as transition studies, Actor Network Theory, animal studies, feminist posthumanism, post­                                                  colonialism and indigenous scholarship to enhance our understanding of participation by non-humans.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The review points at three themes for better engagement of non-humans in                                                  design, notably regarding the role of (1) agency; (2) temporality; and (3) deliberation of non-humans. Based on                                                  these themes, practical steps forward are proposed to include non-humans in five design phases: problem defi­                                                  nition; system analysis; design requirements; measurements; and selecting design solutions.                                                  SIGNIFICANCE: By opening a dialogue between agricultural systems design and different bodies of research on                                                  inclusion of non-humans, this article aims to support agricultural systems designers in their reflection, making                                                  informed, context-sensitive decisions by fostering new ways of thinking and relating to non-humans as active                                                  rather than passive actors in these processes, thereby enhancing the transformative potential of agricultural                                                  systems research and design beyond anthropocentric perspectives.
