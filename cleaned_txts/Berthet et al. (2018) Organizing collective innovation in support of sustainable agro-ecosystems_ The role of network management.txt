Keywords:                                                   Designing and managing sustainable agro-ecosystems remains a signiﬁcant challenge for society. This is largely Collective action                                           because their expected functions and values are multiple, and diverse networks of actors and institutions control Network governance                                          common pool resources at diﬀerent scales. Networks are expected to play an important role in facilitating Design reasoning                                            collective innovation in agro-ecosystems, through enabling knowledge acquisition and transfer, resource moSustainability                                                             bilization for eﬀective governance, and cooperation. However, in order to realize their potential beneﬁt netInnovation brokering                                                             works require eﬀective management. Drawing on case studies located in the peri-urban agro-ecosystems surrounding Montreal (Quebec, Canada) and Paris (France), we analyze four collective innovation initiatives aiming                                                             to reduce the negative impacts of agriculture on the environment. For each case, we assess the contribution of                                                             network managers to the core tasks of: “Connecting” (initiating and facilitating interaction processes between                                                             actors), “Framing” (guiding interactions through process agreement), “Knowledge brokering” (facilitating                                                             knowledge transfer and capitalization) and “Exploring” (searching for goal congruency by creating new content). We then pay particular attention to the activities associated with Exploring across our cases and consider                                                             the implications for more collective approaches to designing innovation in agricultural landscapes. Our results                                                             suggest that, despite heterogeneity in the activities of network managers in each context, network managers                                                             devoted eﬀorts across each of the four tasks. Yet, building a shared vision and engaging diverse stakeholders in a                                                             common goal over time were reported as challenging. We identify that the network managers tended to set                                                             objectives at the outset, and that design processes were often conﬁned to a limited subgroup of actors. While                                                             these strategies were viewed as being eﬃcient in the short term, they likely limited the success of the collective                                                             enterprise in the long run.
Introduction                                                                                 reasoning, i.e. exploring the unknown, on the basis of knowledge capitalization and the formulation of what is desirable (Hatchuel et al.,     Deﬁning and creating sustainable agro-ecosystems remains a sig-                             2009). This is all the more challenging when considering that knowlniﬁcant challenge for society. This is largely because their expected                           edge concerning agro-ecosystems is limited and fragmented, their defunctions are multiple (Foley et al., 2005), their values are partly un-                        limitation is unclear, stakeholders often have diverging interests, and known and they are often perceived diﬀerently by social actors (Martín-                         there is no single legitimate designer (Berthet et al., 2016).

However, as noted                             Leeuwis, 2009), the allocation of key resources for eﬀective governance by Giest and Howlett (2014), such innovation networks are not self-                              (Carlsson and Sandström, 2008), a commitment to common rules forming or auto-poetic, requiring leadership to enable reciprocal com-                           among actors (Scholz and Wang, 2006), and the resolution of conﬂicts munication ﬂows among heterogeneous actors, build trust and ensure                               (Hahn et al., 2006; Bodin and Crona, 2009).

However, such networks generally require eﬀective nizational aspects of managing collective innovation processes, and the                          management in order to realize their potential (Giest and Howlett, cognitive aspects of social learning and knowledge brokering. However,                           2014). According to Giest and Howlett (2014), the role of network the contribution of network managers to steering innovative design                               managers, whether they be a formal association, a speciﬁc individual, processes has, to date, received much less attention. Using innovative                           an organization or some combination of these, is key to realizing coldesign theory (Hatchuel et al., 2009) that formalizes design reasoning,                          lective outcomes. More speciﬁcally, the management strategies of leathis paper seeks to help address this knowledge gap. Drawing on four                             ders will signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the structure and dynamics of the collectively organized innovation initiatives that aimed to reduce the                           network (Gage et al., 1990; Meier and O'Toole Jr, 2001). negative environmental impacts of agriculture in the peri-urban agro-                                Previous research has helped to conceptualize the various roles and ecosystems surrounding Montreal (Quebec, Canada) and Paris (France),                             functions of network managers in realizing collective action (Table 1) we explore the core role played by network managers in setting up and                            [see, for example, Klijn et al., 2010 and Giest and Howlett, 2014].

Assisted by the researchers, the NGO                            Ten farmers interested in hemp founded an association; then in 2010, organized the procedure for the construction of the wetland                           they set up a private ﬁrm, bought a piece of land and acquired a hemp (speciﬁcations, call for proposals, etc.).

Yet, an interviewee reported weak links with the producers: “It's valves and the management of the constructed wetland: with the                        still fragile, we do not have the conﬁdence of all farmers yet, we still do not municipality, the farmers and the union.” (FR1-C&D).

The conﬁguration chosen not set up a speciﬁc governance structure for the project, instead                    for the supply chain, a private ﬁrm versus a cooperative, likely played a organizing meetings on an ad hoc basis.                                               role in this situation: “We are criticized for having set up a simpliﬁed jointstock company [SAS in French] and not a cooperative, but we did not want 4.1.3.3.

With regard With regard to collecting information, the researchers gathered                       to activating the right players, the associated farmers built a network considerable technical knowledge on the aquifer's hydrology and also                  with hemp producers, local authorities, agricultural extension services, on a constructed wetland they established in another location between                 research institutions and a national association promoting hemp in the 2005 and 2007.

Through the project, the associated farmers reportedly pursued a shared 4.1.4.2. Framing. Framing was a major concern for the associated                         goal: “With [the association], farmers did not just want to ‘feed the planet’, farmers.

However, despite the project seemingly and grain that should be provided to the transformation unit each year,                  motivating many farmers, the sense of ownership was not necessarily stipulating that the farmers have to comply with the ﬁrm's speciﬁcation                  shared at a larger scale: “In my opinion, [the hemp producers] look more at regarding, for instance, farming practices and delivery planning.

Existing studies who underlined the importance of the network manager seeing the ‘big                on social network management have tended to concentrate on inpicture’ in order to identify members that ﬁll a knowledge gap within               novation diﬀusion and consider innovation as the result of a process, the network or connect parties that would beneﬁt from working to-                   with less attention paid to how agricultural innovations ‘come to life’ gether.

The literature on innovaportance on the Framing tasks, which corresponds to the ability of the              tion intermediaries considers innovation processes, but tends to focus managers to set rules and create network arrangements, and thus give                on the roles of demand articulation, network formation and innovation actors a platform to interact and exchange knowledge. These tasks are               process management (see for instance Klerkx and Leeuwis, 2009; known to be key determinants of network activity and eﬀectiveness                   Batterink et al., 2010; Kilelu et al., 2011). As noted by Klijn et al., 2010, (Provan and Kenis, 2007; Kilelu et al., 2011; Hellin, 2012), as they can            the exploring process is sometimes short of creative solutions to satisfy reduce the complexity and uncertainty of the relationships and make                 the various actors involved.

However, in a context where innovation and systemic ap2004) and to develop solutions that create opportunities for actors to              proaches are particularly needed, a problem-solving approach may participate.

Recent advances in these collective initiatives in the long term. This ﬁnding echoes what              design theories (Hatchuel et al., 2009; Le Masson et al., 2010) highlight Klerkx and Leeuwis (2009) called the tensions and paradoxes of in-                  that design requires various cognitive operations, such as knowledge novation brokers, related for instance to embeddedness and im-                      creation, external knowledge integration and knowledge re-ordering, partiality, when their position in the innovation network and their                 that could be categorized as knowledge management, but also ideation objectives are not fully understood. Further, network managers often                (i.e., generation of ideas); and that these activities are intertwined. Our adapt their functions to speciﬁc contexts (e.g. Kilelu et al., 2011; Klerkx         results suggest that network managers likely have strong skills in terms et al., 2010) and focus on particular functions according to the net-               of knowledge management.

Further reexample, following van Lente et al.
