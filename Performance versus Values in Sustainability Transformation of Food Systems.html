        <h1>Performance versus Values in Sustainability Transformation of Food Systems</h1>
        <p class="author">Hugo F. Alrøe, Marion Sautier, Katharine Legun, Jay Whitehead, Egon Noe, Henrik Moller and Jon Manhire</p>

        <div class="summary-section">
            <h2>全文概要总结</h2>
            <h3>1. 论点 (Argument)</h3>
            <p>本文的核心论点在于，可持续性转型过程中，以绩效为导向（Performance-based）的方法和以价值观为导向（Values-based）的方法虽然在实际应用中常交织在一起，但其底层逻辑（即行动的理性基础）是根本互补而非可融合的。作者提出，通过韦伯的工具理性与价值理性区分来解析这两种方法，发现它们各自的优缺点，并在此基础上引入一种超越性的“反思性理性”（Reflexive Rationality），以应对社会-生态系统转型中的复杂性与不确定性，尤其是在食品系统可持续性转型中的应用。</p>
            <h3>2. 论据 (Evidence)</h3>
            <p>作者通过多重论据支撑其核心论点：</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>韦伯的理性类型学：</strong> 引入马克斯·韦伯关于社会行动中工具理性（zweckrational）和价值理性（wertrational）的区分，作为分析可持续性转型中不同行动理性的核心概念框架。同时，也提及了情感理性（affectual）和传统理性（traditional）的边缘性。</li>
                <li><strong>理想型建构：</strong> 将绩效导向和价值观导向的方法各自视为一种“理想型”（ideal-type），以凸显其在理论上的纯粹性与现实中的近似性，从而避免单一视角的偏颇。</li>
                <li><strong>案例分析：</strong> 选取了四个代表性案例进行跨案例分析：可持续性联盟（TSC）、新西兰可持续性仪表板（NZSD）代表绩效导向方法；以及健康成长（HealthyGrowth）、多重信任平台（MTP）代表价值观导向方法。这些案例涵盖了全球消费品行业、新西兰农业生产、欧洲替代性食品链和有机食品系统，提供了实践层面的证据。</li>
                <li><strong>利益相关者参与模式：</strong> 分析了不同方法中利益相关者（包括赞助商、开发者、受益者、变革推动者）的参与方式和目的，以及知识和价值观在其中扮演的角色，例如Biggs的四种参与模式（契约式、咨询式、协作式、院校式）。</li>
                <li><strong>有机农业的张力：</strong> 将有机农业作为探讨绩效与价值观方法之间张力的一个典型案例，揭示了其在原则与实践、认证与价值沟通之间的内在矛盾。</li>
                <li><strong>动机理论：</strong> 引入内在动机（intrinsic motivation）和外在动机（extrinsic motivation）的区分，来进一步解释行动者采取可持续行动的心理基础，并强调内在动机在价值观导向方法中的重要性。</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>3. 论证过程 (Reasoning Process)</h3>
            <p>文章的论证过程严谨且层层递进：</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>问题提出：</strong> 开篇指出可持续性科学在知识生产与实际转型之间存在的“实施问题”，即评估不必然导致转型。</li>
                <li><strong>概念界定与理论框架：</strong> 借用韦伯的工具理性与价值理性，为理解不同转型路径提供理论基础，并阐明这两种理性互斥而非融合的本质。</li>
                <li><strong>理想型构建：</strong> 将两种方法抽象为理想型，为后续的比较分析提供清晰的参照点。</li>
                <li><strong>案例比较分析：</strong> 通过对四个具体案例的细致剖析，分别阐述了绩效导向和价值观导向方法在食品系统观、利益相关者参与、知识与价值观作用以及转型路径上的差异。</li>
                <li><strong>优势与劣势总结：</strong> 归纳了两种方法各自的优势和劣势，例如绩效导向擅长量化和目标调整，但可能忽视不可量化因素和价值观；价值观导向擅长协调价值观和激发内在动机，但可能缺乏可衡量性。</li>
                <li><strong>互补性论证：</strong> 强调了两种理性（及其对应的方法）的根本互补性，即它们基于互斥的观察者立场，无法简单融合为“中间最优解”。</li>
                <li><strong>反思性理性提出：</strong> 在互补性的基础上，提出了“反思性理性”作为一种超越性的解决方案，它能同时考虑现有知识、知识的局限性以及价值观，并在不确定性下采取审慎行动（如预防原则）。</li>
                <li><strong>未来展望：</strong> 呼吁开发能将反思性理性付诸实践的工具，并强调决策者、研究人员和变革推动者需要扩展其推理模式。</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>4. 方法 (Method)</h3>
            <p>本文采用的主要研究方法是：</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>概念分析与理论建构：</strong> 运用马克斯·韦伯的社会行动理论，特别是工具理性与价值理性的区分，构建了分析可持续性转型路径的理论框架。作者将绩效导向和价值观导向的方法抽象为“理想型”，作为分析工具。</li>
                <li><strong>跨案例比较分析（Cross-Case Analysis）：</strong> 选取了四个真实世界的项目或倡议作为案例，进行深入的比较分析。这些案例被刻意选择为“极端案例”（extreme cases），以更好地揭示两种理想型方法的核心特征及其运作机制。案例分析的重点在于考察其行动的理性基础（Rationale or Ground of Action）和利益相关者参与方式（Analysis of Stakeholder Involvement）。</li>
                <li><strong>利益相关者参与分析框架：</strong> 作者设计了一个框架来分析利益相关者的参与，包括识别利益相关者的角色（赞助商、开发者、受益者、变革推动者、间接相关者）以及参与模式（契约式、咨询式、协作式、院校式）。</li>
                <li><strong>思辨与论证：</strong> 论文的讨论部分通过思辨性论证，探讨了两种方法的动机角色、有机农业的案例张力、理性的互补性与动态性，并最终提出了“反思性理性”这一新概念。</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>5. 案例 (Case/Example)</h3>

                        <p>本章指出粮食生产对气候变化、生物多样性和环境资源（水、土壤、空气）产生重大影响，并在全球范围内威胁着地球边界。尽管科学界开发了大量可持续性评估方法，但这些评估并不必然导致可持续性转型。研究界存在描述性分析与行动导向研究之间的张力，对社会-生态系统的理解不足以直接解决实际问题。因此，如何促成转型性变革以及解决从评估到转型的“实施问题”成为可持续性科学的核心挑战。</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                作者指出，食品生产对气候变化、生物多样性和环境资源（如水、土壤和空气）产生了显著影响，并且在全球范围内对地球边界构成威胁。
                                <blockquote>Food production has substantial impacts on climate change, biodiversity and environmental resources such as water, soil, and air [3], and it plays a significant role in the global threats to planetary boundaries [4,5].</blockquote>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                尽管已经开发了许多可持续性评估方法来帮助食品系统变得更可持续，但评估并不自动导致可持续性转型。
                                <blockquote>Accordingly, a wealth of sustainability assessment methods has been developed by science to help food systems become more sustainable (e.g., [6–8]). However, the transition to sustainability does not necessarily start with an evaluation of sustainability, and sustainability assessment does not automatically lead to sustainability transformation [9–19].</blockquote>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                研究界普遍存在描述和分析导向的研究与行动和发展导向的研究之间的张力，单纯地理解复杂社会-生态系统并不能提供实践中的解决方案。
                                <blockquote>Generally, there is a tension between research that is oriented toward description and analysis and research that is oriented toward action and development [20]. A better understanding of complex social-ecological systems in itself does not necessarily offer solutions to sustainability problems in practice [18,21].</blockquote>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                可持续性科学虽然显著增加了我们对复杂社会-生态系统问题的理解，但在如何将这些知识转化为可持续性转型方面进展不足。
                                <blockquote>While sustainability science has increased our understanding of complex problems in social-ecological systems substantially, progress on how this knowledge can lead to transition to sustainability is lacking.</blockquote>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Miller et al. (2014)提出了关于科学和知识在促进可持续性成果中作用的关键问题，包括科学的适当角色、何种科学有用以及如何最好地参与可持续解决方案的实施。
                                <blockquote>On this basis, Miller et al. [34] (p. 244) pose some very fundamental questions on the role of science and knowledge in facilitating sustainability outcomes: “What is the appropriate role of science in contributing to action and decision-making for sustainability? What kind of science is useful for this purpose? What knowledge, if any, is needed to make better decisions? How can sustainability science best participate in the implementation of sustainable solutions?”</blockquote>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                知识与价值观，以及它们之间的关系，似乎是解决“实施问题”的核心，即如何将可持续性评估付诸实践，以实现食品系统及其他社会-生态系统的转型。
                                <blockquote>Knowledge and values, and the relation between knowledge and values, thus seem to be at the center stage in the question of how to “implement” sustainability assessments to achieve transformations towards sustainability in food systems and in other social-ecological systems.</blockquote>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                利益相关者参与被越来越多地认为是解决实施问题的一个方案，因为环境问题的复杂性和动态性需要灵活透明的决策，并整合多样化的知识和价值观。
                                <blockquote>Participatory processes are increasingly suggested to be a solution to the implementation problem. In a large review of stakeholder participation for environmental management, Mark S. Reed states that: “The complex and dynamic nature of environmental problems requires flexible and transparent decision-making that embraces a diversity of knowledges and values. For this reason, stakeholder participation in environmental decision-making has been increasingly sought and embedded into national and international policy.” [39] (p. 2417).</blockquote>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                然而，仅仅参与本身不足以克服实施问题，甚至跨学科研究（包括深入的参与和实践知识整合）也未必能带来可持续方向的改变。Reed (2008) 强调参与需要以赋权、公平、信任和学习的理念为基础。
                                <blockquote>However, there is a growing general acknowledgement that participation in itself is not enough to overcome the implementation problem [39,40]. “Although many benefits have been claimed for participation, disillusionment has grown amongst practitioners and stakeholders who have felt let down when these claims are not realised.” [39] (p. 2417). Even transdisciplinary research that includes in-depth participation and integration of practice knowledge does not necessarily result in change in a sustainable direction [41]. Reed concludes that “stakeholder participation needs to be underpinned by a philosophy that emphasises empowerment, equity, trust and learning.” [39] (p. 2426).</blockquote>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                可持续性评估工具本身也可能增加转型失败的风险，因为许多可持续性属性难以衡量，且任何评估工具都预设了基本价值判断。要充分发挥其效用，需要揭示和处理其价值基础，并关注价值沟通、动机和信任。
                                <blockquote>The sustainability assessment approach may itself also increase risk of transformation failure. The development of multicriteria sustainability assessments enhances the knowledge basis for making decisions towards sustainability transformation through better tools and more appropriate tool choices (e.g., [44]). However, it has proven harder than expected to put into practice the principles of sustainability assessment [45,46]. Many sustainability attributes are not (yet) measurable and “hard” methodologies need to be complemented by “soft” methodologies which are at least able to identify critical issues and trade-offs [45]. Since any assessment tool has already assumed fundamental value judgements related to what is considered good or not good in terms of sustainability [47], the full effectiveness of such tools can only be reached by exposing and working with the value basis in relation to value communication, motivation and trust [48].</blockquote>

                                Alrøe et al. (2016) 呼吁比较绩效导向和价值观导向方法在实现可持续食品系统转型方面的优缺点和互补性，指出这两种方法基于截然不同的行动基础。
                                <blockquote>Alrøe et al. [48] call for comparisons of the strengths, weaknesses and complementarities of performance-based and values-based approaches to bringing about real transformation towards more sustainable food systems. These contraposed approaches exhibit very different grounds of action.</blockquote>

                                本文旨在通过分析转型背后的理性（即变革推动者的行动基础），比较和分析绩效导向和价值观导向方法，并结合马克斯·韦伯的工具理性和价值理性区分来深入探讨。
                                <blockquote>In this paper we compare and analyze performance-based and values-based approaches to sustainability transformation of food systems by analyzing the rationale behind the transformation—the basis that the direct agents of change (including individuals, businesses and governmental and non-governmental organizations) are assumed to act upon—and how the type of rationale is connected with how the agents of change are involved and how research is involved in the approach [50,51]. To do this we employ Max Weber’s distinction between instrumental rationality and value-rationality in social action [52,53] (see also [54]).</blockquote>

                        <p>本章详细阐述了用于分析可持续性转型方法的框架，核心是马克斯·韦伯的社会行动理性区分。作者将工具理性和价值理性作为两种主要的行动基础进行对比，强调其纯粹的概念形式有助于理解社会现实。同时，本章还介绍了将绩效导向和价值观导向方法视为“理想型”的理由，并阐述了跨案例分析和利益相关者参与分析的具体方法。</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                作者使用韦伯关于工具理性（zweckrational）和价值理性（wertrational）的区分来分析绩效导向和价值观导向方法中促进可持续性转型所采用的理性基础。
                                <blockquote>We use the distinction, suggested by Weber, between instrumental rationality (sometimes translated as “means-ends rationality”) and value-rationality to analyze the rationale that is employed to promote sustainability transformation in performance-based and values-based approaches: “Social action, like all action, may be oriented in four ways. It may be: (1) instrumentally rational (zweckrational), that is, determined by expectations as to the behavior of objects in the environment and of other human beings; these expectations are used as “conditions” or “means” for the attainment of the actor's own rationally pursued and calculated ends; (2) value-rational (wertrational), that is, determined by a conscious belief in the value for its own sake of some ethical, aesthetic, religious, or other form of behavior, independently of its prospects of success; (3) affectual (especially emotional), that is, determined by the actor’s specific affects and feeling states; (4) traditional, that is, determined by ingrained habituation.” [52] (p. 25).</blockquote>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                价值理性行动通过明确表达指导行动的价值观，以及行动对这些价值观的持续有意和目的性导向，与情感类型区分开来。行动的意义不在于结果的实现，而在于行动本身的内在价值。
                                <blockquote>Value-rational action is distinguished from the affectual type by its explicit formulation of the values governing the action and the consistent intentional and purposeful orientation of the action to these values [52,56]. Since value is what is pursued through action, it is a cause or ground of action, but it is also the end of action, the good that is sought [57]. However, the meaning of the action does not lie in the achievement of end results, but in the intrinsic value of the action, irrespective of the likelihood of success or of costs that might occur [58].</blockquote>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                相比之下，工具理性行动基于对行动后果（如预期收益和成本）的知识（期望）。手段、目的和次要后果都被理性地考虑和衡量。目的和目标总是基于价值观的，但工具行动的特点是行动基于如何实现这些目的的知识期望，而不是价值观本身。
                                <blockquote>By contrast, instrumentally rational action is based on knowledge (expectations) of the consequences of the action (e.g., expected benefits and costs). The means, the end, and the secondary consequences are all rationally considered, taken into account, and weighed. Ends, goals, and aims are always values-based, but what characterizes instrumental action is that actions are grounded in the knowledge-based expectations of how to reach those ends and not in those values in themselves (see also [53]).</blockquote>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                韦伯强调，不同的生活领域可以根据非常不同的终极价值观和目的进行理性化，并且“从一个角度来看是理性的东西，从另一个角度来看可能就是非理性的”。
                                <blockquote>More generally, Weber pointed out that different departments of life such as mystical contemplation, economic life, technique, scientific research, military training, law, and administration may be rationalized in terms of very different ultimate values and ends, and: “what is rational from one point of view may well be irrational from another” [59] (p. 26). In particular, the value-rational must appear completely irrational from the viewpoint of instrumental rationality (cf., [52,53]), but: “A thing is never irrational in itself, but only from a particular rational point of view.” [59] (p. 194).</blockquote>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                尼克拉斯·卢曼（Niklas Luhmann）进一步将这种视角的理性化推向极致，指出理性理由一般不独立于社会系统的视角而存在，理性概念仅是系统自我反思最苛刻的视角。
                                <blockquote>This perspectival view of rationality was radicalized further by Niklas Luhmann, who pointed out that in general rationales do not exist outside the perspectives of social systems: “Modern society’s principle of differentiation makes the question of rationality more urgent—and at the same time insoluble. . . . The concept of rationality merely formulates the most demanding perspective on a system’s self-reflection. It does not signify a norm, a value, or an idea that confronts real systems. (That would presuppose someone who says that it is rational to be guided by this.) It merely indicates the keystone of the logic of self-referential systems.” [60] (p. 477).</blockquote>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                韦伯将“理想型”概念视为理解和分析社会现实的方法论工具，它通过单方面强调一个或多个视角并综合大量分散的现象，构建一个统一的思维结构，并非现实的描述，而是构建假设的指导。
                                <blockquote>The types of rationality are thus proposed as “ideal-types”, a notion conceived by Weber as a methodological tool to help understand and analyze social reality: “. . . we can make the characteristic features of [the relationship between empirical data and an abstract construct] pragmatically clear and understandable by reference to an ideal-type. This procedure can be indispensable for heuristic as well as expository purposes. The ideal typical concept will help to develop our skill in interpretation in research: it is no ‘hypothesis’ but it offers guidance to the construction of hypotheses. It is not a description of reality but it aims to give unambiguous means of expression to such a description. . . . An ideal type is formed by the one-sided accentuation of one or more points of view and by the synthesis of a great many diffuse, discrete, more or less present and occasionally absent concrete individual phenomena, which are arranged according to those one-sidedly emphasized viewpoints into a unified thought construct. In its conceptual purity, this mental construct cannot be found empirically anywhere in reality. It is a utopia.” [61] (p. 90).</blockquote>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                绩效导向方法（作为理想型）基于选择的绩效衡量和指标形式的工具理性制度化，而价值观导向方法（作为理想型）基于一套制度化的价值观，即一套指导日常实践和发展倡议的共识价值观。
                                <blockquote>As an ideal-type, the performance-based approach is based on the institutionalization of an instrumental reason for action in form of selected performance measures and indicators [66], i.e., sustainability assessment tools and frameworks like multicriteria assessments (MCA) and key performance indicators (KPI). Performance-based approaches aim at enhancing the abilities of practitioners to achieve sustainable outcomes, in part by rewarding those activities through their verification and social or economic marketability. The values-based approach, as ideal-type, is based on a set of institutionalized values, i.e., a set of agreed upon values that directs the decisions and actions of daily practices and development initiatives. Many individual, community and organizational approaches to sustainability transformation are values-based in this sense; for example, organic farming and food systems directed by overall values and ethical principles.</blockquote>

                                跨案例分析是一种研究方法，通过比较不同背景的案例来理解案例间的关系，提炼和发展概念，构建或检验理论，并通过学习一个案例来改进另一个案例。
                                <blockquote>Cross-case analysis is a research method that allows researchers to compare cases from different settings, communities, or groups to understand relationships among the cases, refine and develop concepts, and build or test theory [67]. Some features of cross-case analysis are: cases represent rich examples of experiences; cases are comparable in relation to certain patterns of similarities and differences; comparisons among cases can construct and yield meaningful linkages, analogies, inferences, and conditional generalizations; and the analysis provides possibilities for learning from one case to another.</blockquote>

                                作者根据利益相关者在项目中的作用，将其分为五类：赞助商、开发者、受益者、变革推动者和间接相关者，并着重关注“直接变革推动者”以分析转型潜力。
                                <blockquote>We differentiate stakeholders by their role in the approach, and we have identified five such stakeholder roles: Sponsors, who fund or otherwise support the specific project or initiative. Developers, who work to research and develop the project or initiative. Beneficiaries, for whom the project or initiative has been created, and who will directly benefit from it. Agents of change, on whom the transformation of the system directly relies, and who are expected to change their practices as a result of the project or initiative. Indirectly involved stakeholders, who are not engaged directly in the project or initiative, but who are either susceptible to be affected (positively or negatively) by it, or who indirectly affects it.</blockquote>

                            <li>
                                利益相关者的参与方式通过Biggs（1989）的四种参与模式（契约式、咨询式、协作式、院校式）进行识别和分析，但强调此处“参与”在某些情况下是反向的，即利益相关者是转型的主体，研究是其辅助。
                                <blockquote>We identify the way in which the agents of changes are involved in the project through Biggs’ [71] framework of four participation modes as generalized by Probst and Hagmann [72] and Barreteau et al. [73]: Contractual (stakeholders are “contracted” to provide input) Consultative (the “owner” gathers information by consultation) Collaborative (with exchange of knowledge on an equal footing) Collegiate (with a shared ownership of the process)</blockquote>

                                <strong>可持续性联盟 (TSC)</strong> 是一个全球性非营利组织，致力于通过科学和商业的结合，推动消费品行业向更可持续的产品转型。其工作围绕衡量特定产品类别的可持续性特征，旨在通过设定关键绩效指标（KPIs）和基准，促使食品系统中的主体进行变革，并在市场中获得商业优势。
                                <blockquote>The Sustainability Consortium is a global nonprofit organization working at the intersection of science and business to transform the consumer goods industry to deliver more sustainable products [74]. Their work is organized around measuring the sustainability profiles of particular product categories, of which “Food, Beverage & Agriculture” is a predominant example. TSC aims to create credible, scalable tools, strategies and services that are based in science, informed by stakeholders and focused on impact across the entire lifecycle of products, including environmental, social and economic imperatives.</blockquote>

                                <strong>新西兰可持续性仪表板 (NZSD)</strong> 项目旨在为食品生产商和行业开发可持续性评估工具，并设定可持续性指标目标，以激励农业系统向可持续性和韧性转型。该项目基于国际文献，建立了涵盖环境、社会、经济和良好治理四个支柱的结构化框架，并为每个行业开发绩效衡量指标，与“参考值”进行对比。
                                <blockquote>The New Zealand Sustainability Dashboard project (2012-18) aims at developing sustainability assessment tools for food producers and industries, and at setting sustainability indicator targets that motivate the transformation of farming systems for sustainability and resilience [76]. The project has developed a structured framework based on international literature that has identified the four pillars of sustainability—environmental integrity, social well-being, economic resilience and good governance.</blockquote>

                                <strong>健康成长 (HG)</strong> 项目旨在识别能够在规模增长的同时不丧失其价值基础的替代性食品链，以学习如何通过价值观导向的食品链促进食品系统转型。项目通过跨学科视角对欧洲10个国家的19个价值观导向食品链案例进行研究，发现价值沟通在链条成功中至关重要，价值不能被简化为经济价值。
                                <blockquote>The HealthyGrowth project (2013–2016) aimed to identify alternative food chains that are able to grow in volume without losing the value basis that they started from, in order to learn (1) how the growth of values-based food chains can help the transformation into more sustainable food systems; (2) to what extent such values-based food chains can function as a sound foundation for the integrity of organics and consumer trust; and (3) to what extent they constitute a substantial potential for development and growth of organic markets.</blockquote>

                                <strong>多重信任平台 (MTP)</strong> 项目旨在研究如何对有机食品系统对社会和自然的影响进行整体评估和沟通，以帮助有机行动者根据其伦理原则发展有机食品系统。该项目提出一个合作性沟通平台，通过展示和沟通食品链中不同行动者在决策和发展倡议时所使用的价值负载标准。
                                <blockquote>The MultiTrust project (2011–2014) investigated methods to make and communicate overall assessments of the effects of organic food systems on society and nature to help organic actors develop the organic food systems in line with their ethical principles [80]. Organic agriculture is seen as a self-organizing system based on a shared meaning. This is expressed in the principles of organic agriculture, which are the result of a large and global process to formulate basic ethical principles for organic agriculture [81,82].</blockquote>

                        <p>本章总结了对四个案例进行跨案例分析的结果，揭示了绩效导向和价值观导向方法在食品系统观、利益相关者参与、知识与价值观作用以及可持续性转型路径上的显著差异。这些差异表明，不同的方法背后有着不同的理性基础。</p>
                        <ul>

                                <strong>食品系统和变革的观点：</strong> 可持续性联盟（TSC）将食品系统视为全球市场系统，关注消费品行业，通过可持续性认证促使产品竞争。新西兰可持续性仪表板（NZSD）将食品系统视为生产系统，关注本地农民和产业，通过评估和基准促进农业系统转型。健康成长（HG）将食品系统视为自组织食品链，关注替代性、价值观导导向的食品链，通过价值沟通促进转型。多重信任平台（MTP）将食品系统视为自组织系统，关注基于共享价值观的有机食品系统，通过沟通价值标准促进实践发展。
                                <blockquote>The Sustainability Consortium sees the food system as a global market system, focusing on the consumer goods industry (i.e., large businesses in global chains), and operates to enable competition between products based on their sustainability credentials. This has the dual purpose of enabling companies to compete on and profit from making more sustainable products and in this way encouraging the development of more sustainable food systems. Sustainability is seen as a feature that products have to a larger or lesser degree. <br> The NZ Sustainability Dashboard mainly sees the food system as a production system, focusing on localized (i.e., New Zealand) farmers and industries, and operates to assist and motivate the transformation to sustainable farming systems. The dual purpose is to promote sustainable transformation of the farming systems through scoring and benchmarking and enable them to compete better on a global market increasingly concerned with sustainability. Sustainability is seen as a state that farming systems can move toward. <br> HealthyGrowth sees the food system as self-organizing food chains, focusing on alternative, values-based and presumably more sustainable food chains, and operates to identify ways for alternative food chains to compete and grow in the food market and thereby make the food system more sustainable. The purpose is to investigate what enables such chains to grow in volume without losing their integrity and consumer trust. Sustainability is seen as an ongoing process that has to be continuously discussed and mediated in the food chain. <br> MultiTrust sees the food system as a self-organizing system, focusing on organic food systems based on shared values and ethical principles, and operates to develop tools that help actors in the system communicate on the criteria they use for making decisions and taking initiatives to develop their practice. The purpose is to investigate how overall assessments may be used to help transform food systems to the better by exposing and communicating their value basis. Sustainability is seen as a continuing process of development based on communication of values.</blockquote>

                                <strong>利益相关者参与：</strong> TSC通过市场认证框架让主要市场参与者和供应商参与，成员以大学院式参与开发，供应商以契约式参与。NZSD项目让初级产业合作伙伴参与开发评估框架，农民作为变革推动者，参与模式多样（契约式、咨询式、协作式）。HG支持食品链主体组织自己的链条和价值沟通，食品链主体是直接变革推动者，研究者是辅助参与者，参与模式为大学院式。MTP被设计为融入有机食品系统的工具，支持行动者沟通价值标准，早期是协作式，计划转为完全大学院式。
                                <blockquote>The Sustainability Consortium involves main market players and product suppliers in a common framework of sustainability accreditation. The involvement of the TSC members in developing the assessment framework indicates that they consider sustainability an important marketing factor. Members fund the initiative and are the beneficiaries of the tools that are being developed. In the development team, there are member representatives (often chairing the working groups), experts from companies, and associated researchers involved in the construction and prioritization of measures and indicators, and effectively elaborating new sustainability standards for market accreditation. Decision-making is, however, limited to the members. The suppliers are direct agents of change, and they must comply with the new requirements to gain access to the growing market segment for sustainable products. They are not part of the development team, nor involved in testing or giving feedback on the approach. The involvement of the suppliers can thus be described as contractual. <br> The NZ Sustainability Dashboard project involves partners from the primary industry in developing the sustainability assessment framework and in setting targets to be achieved. NZSD is funded by the New Zealand government and several industries and universities. The beneficiaries are the participating industries and individual farmers in those industries. Farmers are direct agents of change, and they are expected to feed data to the sustainability assessment tool and adjust their farming performance in accordance with their benchmarking and performance relative to reference values. In most cases the developers are consultants (who chair the working groups), researchers from the associated universities, and industry partners. Farmers are consulted about their expectations for the tool and to test tool prototypes by way of stakeholder workshops, surveys and interviews. In the kiwifruit industry farmers are included in the development to help define the goal and structure of the tool, following a collaborative mode of participation. In other industries, such as New Zealand Wine, the participation of farmers is more institutionalized and channeled through industry governance and management. In this case the industry is a direct agent of change in the same way that government regulation is a direct agent of change in so far as the institutional rules and regulations can be enforced. <br> HealthyGrowth works to support the agents of the food chains in organizing their own chains and the value communication in the chain. HG is an EU ERA-net project funded by ten member states, with the alternative organic food chains as main beneficiaries. HG researchers are the main developers of the project as such, but the initiation and development of the alternative food chains is solely in the hands of the food chain agents (including producers, retailers, consumers, etc.) who are also, by default, the direct agents of change. The question of involvement is thus reversed in this case and researchers can be seen as to some degree involved in the sustainability transformation process. The project makes a point of distinguishing between disciplinary perspectives “owned” by the experts in the respective research fields, and a multi-perspectival research process that includes both research and stakeholder perspectives on an equal footing. The main mode of participation is collegiate in the sense that the food chains have ownership of their own transformation processes and every link in the chain is treated by the other as an equal partner. <br> The MultiTrust platform is conceived as tool that integrates into the organic food systems to support the agents’ own communication about the value-based criteria that are employed, or in demand, for development toward better and more sustainable organic food systems. The MultiTrust project as such is funded by the Danish Ministry of Food, whereas the proposed communicational platform is to be funded and run by the organic food system itself, with the various food system agents (from producers to consumers) as main beneficiaries and the direct agents of change. In the start-up phase the involvement of stakeholders was collaborative, with the MT researchers taking responsibility for initial development. However, the plan is for the organic food system to take over further development and ongoing running of the platform, changing this into a fully collegiate participation mode.</blockquote>

                                <strong>知识与价值观的作用：</strong> TSC侧重于基于科学知识的产品生命周期影响衡量，以量化和指标化为核心。NZSD专注于开发易于获取和计算的评估指标，以绩效衡量为主。HG旨在通过识别成功因素和叙述案例，促进价值观导向食品链的相互学习和价值沟通。MTP则侧重于沟通基于价值观的标准，协调系统中基于价值观的决策。
                                <blockquote>The Sustainability Consortium is focused on measures of impacts across the entire lifecycle of the products based on scientific knowledge. Quantification is a key element, such as the generation of indicators from binary scores of best practices, which allows for subsequent calculation of metrics that compare performance between competitors. TSC’s global database entails a harmonization for comparability that allows for performance hotspot analysis and benchmarking. However, it also channelizes what is measured and how, which carries risks of unintended effects of losing local tuning and diversity and dumbing down other measurements and things that are hard to measure. There is no explicit, system-wide value-rational process that can guide the overall sustainability of decisions and initiatives by the direct agents of change. The approach is thus fundamentally performance based, building primarily on instrumental rationality. <br> The NZ Sustainability Dashboard project focuses on developing assessment metrics that can be easily captured and calculated and where there is a reference for objective performance indicators. The approach is primarily performance based in that it monitors performance assessments in relation to sustainability goals and aspires to set up benchmarks and targets to be achieved. The setting of overall sustainability goals for each industry builds on value-rationality, but the main focus and operation of the approach is based on instrumental rationality. <br> The HealthyGrowth project aims to help existing and new values-based food chains grow by facilitating mutual learning and inspiration through identification of significant success factors and narration of cases, with key chain agents as important communicators. The coherence and growth of the food chains depends on the successful communication about and mediation of these values across the chain. The chains are thus fundamentally based on value-rationality with instrumental rationality as a subordinate ground for action. <br> The MultiTrust project focuses on how overall assessments can help make food systems, especially organic food systems, more sustainable, looking at the role of knowledge, values and communication in such assessments. The main tool for change is an online cooperative, communicational platform that works by exposing and communicating the value-laden criteria that the food chain agents employ when they make decisions on buying or selling or taking new development initiatives. This allows for coordination of values-based decisions in the system and for comparison of stated criteria and tangible initiatives with the organic values and ethical principles. The approach is thus clearly based on value-rationality, bringing in assessments and instrumental rationality only where this makes sense to the food chain agents on the basis of their criteria.</blockquote>

                                <strong>可持续性转型之路：</strong> TSC和NZSD假设评估足以引导转型，并侧重于通过绩效评估来衡量绩效。HG和MTP则假设价值观的强化和培育是驱动转型的最重要因素。
                                <blockquote>The TSC and NZSD approaches assume that assessment is sufficient to lead to transformation and that the underlying values are agreed by the agents of change. Their focus is therefore on measuring performance through assessments. This is based on instrumental rationality. Even though the TSC and NZSD approaches are shaped around sustainability goals, which are evidently values-based, they are operating and set up according to an instrumental rationality where results of performance assessments are intended to drive the transformation. The mechanisms envisioned to lead from assessments to transformation include benchmarking between producers, target setting by industries or market players, and individual or guided learning processes. <br> On the other hand, the HG and MTP approaches assume that reinforcement and nurturing of the values is the most important, even sufficient in itself to drive transformation. They have comparatively little interest in measurement to show that stated values are coupled with practices that produce the outcomes sanctioned by the agreed sustainability values.</blockquote>

                        <p>本章深入探讨了绩效导向和价值观导向方法在可持续性转型中的异同及其带来的挑战。作者总结了两种方法的优缺点，分析了利益相关者角色与行动理性之间的联系，并以有机农业为例展示了两者之间的张力。最终，作者提出了“反思性理性”这一新的理性类型，旨在超越传统理性的局限性，为可持续性转型提供更全面的指导。</p>

                                <strong>利益相关者角色与行动理性：</strong> 绩效导向方法倾向于以工具性的方式让变革推动者参与，以改进结果，如TSC中的供应商和NZSD中的农民，可能通过市场激励或组织手段被要求达到某些目标。这在效率上可能很高，但也可能导致行动者仅以目标为导向，而非以整体可持续性目标为导向，甚至产生负面效果，并可能使变革推动者失去对整体可持续性转型的所有权和动力。
                                <blockquote>Performance-based approaches, on one hand, tend to involve agents of change in an instrumental way to improve results. That is, food chain agents, such as suppliers in TSC and farmers in NZSD, can be compelled by market incitements or organizational means to pursue certain targets that are deemed to be instrumental in bringing about sustainability transformation. This can be very efficient in terms of the ratio of involvement, and it leaves the agents free as to how they are going to meet the targets. However, an important complication is that there is a variety of knowledges and experiences in social-ecological systems [87], and different ways of reasoning among stakeholders such as the different “production logics” found in organic farming [88]. The downside to instrumental involvement is that the actions taken to most efficiently meet the targets may turn out to not actually contribute to sustainability, or even have negative effects, because the agents act instrumentally with the targets as the goal and not based on an orientation toward the overall goal of sustainability. It also risks alienating the agents of change who operate in local conditions dependent on time, place, ecology and culture, leading to a loss of ownership and motivation toward overall sustainability transformation. This is a well-known problem in regulation of agriculture, where there often is a discrepancy between expected and actual outcome of regulation due to differences in values and way of reasoning between the regulatory system [89], thus limiting the capacity of public authorities to act as direct agents of change.</blockquote>

                                价值观导向方法则倾向于通过邀请共享价值观和设定发展方向来让变革推动者参与，如HG和MTP中的食品链主体。虽然这可能因价值观异质性而限制广泛参与，但优点在于所有参与的行动者都在共同的价值基础上行动，他们的行动因此持续地重新导向整体可持续性目标。
                                <blockquote>Values-based approaches, on the other hand, tend to involve agents of change by way of an invitation to share values and set the course of development; in HG the focus is the self-organizing processes of food chains, in MTP it is a tool for exposing and communicating value-based criteria. The food chain agents in HG and MTP can enter into establishing alternative food chains or into developing the organic food system if they to some degree agree with the value basis, or at least are able to act on this basis. This can be a major barrier to a large ratio of involvement due to the observed heterogeneity in values among, e.g., farmers [90]. The upside is that all the actually involved food chain agents act on a common value basis, or on a shared pool of values that are continuously discussed, and that their actions are thereby continuously re-oriented toward the overall goal of sustainability.</blockquote>

                                <strong>动机的角色：</strong> 作者区分了内在动机（出于自身兴趣和内在满足感）和外在动机（为达到某个价值而采取工具性行动）。绩效导向方法基于工具理性，可能削弱对更广泛可持续性价值观的内在动机，因此需要明确的动机策略。内在动机对长期成功至关重要。
                                <blockquote>Following John Maynard Keynes’ distinction between the rational motive for acting (the ground of action) and the psychological motive for acting (the cause of action) [93], we distinguish between three aspects of acting towards sustainability: (1) what the rationale for acting is; (2) what actually makes the agent act; and (3) which acts actually lead to sustainability transformation. <br> The distinction between value-rationality and instrumental rationality reviewed throughout the present paper informs the first aspect. To inform the second, we need to distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation as the basis for the intention to act (see also [94,95]). Intrinsic motivation is when the agent acts out of own interest and inherent satisfaction; it is the prototype of autonomous or self-determined behavior, which does not need encouraging, nudging or whipping from outside. Extrinsic motivation is when the agent acts on something instrumental to a value that is held by the agent. It ranges from acting on incentives from outside to situations where the extrinsic motivation has been more or less internalized [96]. Intrinsic motivation is integrally connected to the needs for competence and autonomy, and feelings of competence, autonomy and relatedness are all crucial factors for the process of internalization. Accordingly, rewards, deadlines, imposed goals, competition, evaluation, and negative feedback have all been shown to decrease intrinsic motivation, presumably because they were experienced as controls [94]. Conversely, positive performance feedback is expected to enhance it.</blockquote>

                                <blockquote>Organic agriculture is an instructive case to illustrate the tension between performance-based and values-based approaches because it embraces aspects of both. Many conflicts within organic agriculture, such as the questions of transport from areas with better production conditions versus zero-miles consumption, the use of irrigation versus preserving water resources, and leaching of nutrients versus animal welfare in outdoor pig production, can be seen as debates around which practices perform best within an instrumental rationale. Similarly, there are tensions between between production forms due to “epistemic barriers”, the fact that not all aspects of sustainability are equally readily revealed [98]. However, there are also tensions reflecting more fundamental divergences between performance-based and values-based approaches. <br> On the one hand, organic agriculture can in itself be considered a values-based approach to sustainability transformation since it builds on an explicit and broadly accepted set of values in form of the Principles of organic agriculture [81,82]. On the other hand, organic agriculture is undergoing a rapid development to improve the production based on research and development that often relies on performance-based methods. A marked tension between the two approaches is expressed, for example, in the distinction between input-replacement organic agriculture and agroecology-based organic agriculture. The first makes the partial, utilitarian changes that are needed to comply with the organic rules in an
